<p>This book does not pretend to be a study of
the Ainu. It is a simple narrative of my journey
in Yezo and a description of the group of Ainu
that I brought to this country. It is true that I
sketch some features of Ainu life and suggest some
questions regarding this peculiarly interesting people.
Readers who wish fuller information will
find much in Rev. John Batchelor’s books.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of the St. Louis
Exposition is life, action. To a greater degree
than in any preceding Exposition the buildings are
full of action—machinery is in motion, artisans
are at work, things are being done. This characteristic
is found in the Department of Anthropology
as well as in those of Machinery and the
Liberal Arts. While it is true that it presents
cases filled with objects, diagrams, maps, pictures,
models, the usual dead material of Ethnographical
and Archæological Museums, it is also true that
it has lavished its main effort upon the outdoor
Ethnological Exhibit, where representatives of upwards
of thirty living tribes are to be seen in native
dress, living in houses of their own construction,
cooking and eating the food to which they are
accustomed at home, and practising those simple
arts and industries, which they have, themselves,
developed. Among these many groups, from
North and South America, from Africa and Asia,
is a little group of the Ainu from Northern Japan,
a people who are, for many reasons, of exceptional
interest.</p>

<p>In August of 1903, I was approached with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
proposition that I should go to Japan to secure
this group and bring it to this country. The plans
for the expedition were finally completed in January
of 1904, and on the 14th of that month I
left St. Louis with one companion, my young Mexican
photographer, Manuel Gonzales. Our journey
to Yokohama was uneventful. We reached
there on February 9th and went up to Tokio on
the 10th, where a stop of several days was necessary
for making preparations, seeing Japanese
officials, securing letters, etc. It was on the night
of the day of our arrival there, that the Japanese
declaration of war against Russia was made. Not
the most favorable hour for asking aid, in a purely
scientific enterprise of no public or political character,
from busy officials! But, through this period
of stress and preparation, of despatching troops
and moving war equipment, we were never disturbed
or delayed in our mission; those officials,
whom we were obliged to meet, received us with
the same courtesy and attended to our requests
with the same care and promptness, as if it were a
time of complete peace. We were profoundly impressed
by the business-like and energetic way in
which all was done and by the deep feeling, though
calm and quiet, among the people. Japan has
gone into this war through necessity; she did all
in her power to avoid hostilities. But, in going
into the war, she expects to win. This expectation
is no idle exhibition of over-confidence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
She fully realizes the enormous advantages Russia
has in size, in numbers, and in resources; but, she
expects, nevertheless, to gain the victory, for she
feels that it is a question of life and death. The
struggle is no new one; nor is it unforeseen. For
more than a century, Japanese patriotic writers
have urged their nation to prepare herself to resist
the aggressions of her powerful neighbor; in 1791
Toshiakira made “a plea for the development of
Yezo, in view of Russian aggression.” In 1801
Yamada Ren made “a passionate appeal for colonizing
Yezo and thus forestalling the designs of
Russia....”</p>

<p>The Ainu are not rovers. It is certainly a rare
thing for members of the race to leave their home.
They have aroused interest for two thousand years.
The Chinese Annals tell of four <em>mao jin</em>, “hairy
men,” who were ship-wrecked on the Chinese coast
in the year 310 A. D. In 650 A. D. some of
them accompanied a Japanese Embassy to China.
So far as we know, none have since left Japan until
this group was brought to this country in 1904.
It is true that they sometimes form one of the attractions
in Japanese circuses and, in 1903, a group
of them was shown at the Osaka Exposition, where
they attracted a great deal of attention and were
so sadly spoiled and corrupted, that we were specially
warned against having anything to do with
any of the group.</p>

<p>During our stay at Tokio, we visited the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
University, where we found the Department
of Anthropology well organized, with Prof. Tsuboi
at its head. It should be better housed than
it is, but it occupies two entire buildings, one of
which is used for recitation rooms, reading room
and laboratory and the other as a Museum, in
which Japan and her dependencies are chiefly represented.
Here we saw extensive collections illustrating
the archæology of Japan—which like the
rest of the world has had a Stone Age—and the
ethnography of the Ainu and the populations of
the Loo Choo Islands, the Bonin Islands, and Formosa.
We were most interested in the Ainu collections,
which are varied and represent arts and
industries, weapons, tools, dress, ornament, etc.
Were we not about to see all these in actual life in
Ainu homes, we should speak of them in detail.
Probably the largest collection of Ainu skeletal material
in the world is in the University Laboratory;
it has been carefully studied and described by a
Japanese, Koganei.</p>

<p>When on Monday, February 15th, we were
ready to start northward things looked squally.
It was reported that communication was interrupted.
Four Russian gunboats, from Vladivostock,
had attacked and sunk a merchant vessel at the
Straits of Tsugaru. We were advised to wait in
Tokio until the announcement of resumption of
communication should be made. Time, however,
was precious. We determined to go on to Aomori<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
as if nothing had occurred, and, if we actually
found no steamer about to sail, to make our way
overland to the northernmost village on the
Hondo, and thence, hiring a fishing-boat and
hoisting an American flag, to cross to the nearest
point of the Island of Yezo. Our railroad journey
to Aomori was a matter of some twenty hours.
We left Tokio with no snow anywhere in sight,
save on Fuji’s summit; when we looked out in the
early morning of the next day, we were in the midst
of winter. Snow covered the whole landscape, not
fresh-fallen snow, but a sheet that had already been
there for weeks and months. Aomori itself is a
quaint fishing-town and port. Snow lay five or
six feet deep in the middle of the street. Shops
and houses are built close together, and have a
continuous passageway or corridor before them.
One may walk, outside, in the middle of the road,
on the elevated snow-way, or inside, on the ground
level, under shelter of the corridor. Here and
there, narrow ways, with steps, cut in the snow permit
passage up and down from one to the other
way. The markets are interesting, particularly
the fish-markets; not only does one see there fishes
of ordinary kinds, both large and small, but flatfish,
such as soles and skates, cuttle-fishes, both
whole and cut into pieces, shell-fish in great variety,
and sea-squirts or tunicates, some of brilliant
colors. Had we space, we could describe the
lacquer which is made here, the New Year offerings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to the gods, the boys flying kites with humming
bows attached, but all these have naught to
do with the Ainu. A little to our satisfaction, for
it would have been a hard trip over the snow to
Omazaki, we found communication restored and
were able to board our little steamer at nine o’clock
and go to bed, although we did not sail until early
in the morning. For fear of mines and hostile vessels,
lying in wait, the run across the Straits of
Tsugaru was made in darkness and slowly. When
we rose in the morning, we were coasting along
the coast of Yezo. There was snow over the landscape
but less than we expected, after our glimpse
of Aomori. The country was hilly; at times,
mountainous; there was but little breadth of beach,
and often the mountains rose abruptly from the
sea-line. Here and there were little clusters of
houses near the seashore. It was bitterly cold and
a piercing wind was blowing. At 9.30 in the
morning, we were in Hakodate Harbor, after passing
through a narrow and tortuous channel. The
town, with a population of perhaps 70,000,
stretches along a coast line, presenting an arc of
almost two-thirds of a circle, and rises upon the
lower slopes of a great mountain mass, which rises
finely in the background and is fortified. We
anchored in the Harbor and would have gone on
shore, if we could have learned that we were to lie
there several hours. There are Ainu settlements
on the outskirts of the city, a Museum of Ainu objects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and a mission station (including a school for
Ainu boys), which we would have been glad to see.
At 3.30 in the afternoon, we started. We could
not find out when we were likely to reach Muroran,
being absolutely without an interpreter, and so
went to bed at nine o’clock, thinking ourselves entitled
to the night’s rest. But at eleven, we were
routed from our beds by the steward and found
ourselves standing in the Bay of Muroran. The
runner from the Maruichi Hotel, to which we had
a letter from our Aomori host, took us in charge
and loaded us and ours into a rowed scow. It was
bitterly cold, a heavy wind was blowing, and snow
filled the air. We were only lighted by paper lanterns,
as, to the songs of the rowers, we crossed the
stretch of tossing waters to the shore. Our pretty
room at the Maruichi, our midnight supper, our
first Japanese bed, and our charcoal fire, were a
pleasant contrast.</p>

<p>The morning was fine, fresh, and cold, with
alternations of blue sky and snow-filled air. Muroran
has a pretty bay, almost circular, land-locked,
with many rock islets dotting it. The town itself
is small and mean, stretching in two or three long
streets at different levels, along the shore. There
are Ainu towns at no great distance and we hoped
to catch our first glimpse of Ainu here but were
disappointed. We strolled through the town buying
some photographs of Ainu and some of the
giant fanshells or pectens, which are the characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
souvenir of Muroran. In all parts of Japan,
except the island of Yezo, each town of any consequence
has its especial product, natural or artificial,
for which it is famous. Japanese, who visit
such towns always carry home, for themselves and
their friends, samples of these. Thus Sendai has
a black fossil wood from which all sorts of trays,
boxes, spoons, teacup-holders, etc., are cut; Aomori
has its especial mottled lacquer; and Morioka
has lovely iron teapots. But Yezo is peculiar; it
is crude and new, a pioneer district of new towns
settled by immigrants from every part of Japan.
Most of its towns have no <em>meibutsu</em> or specialty.
Muroran, however, has as its <em>meibutsu</em>, the giant
fanshells.</p>

<p>At 12.40, we took train for Sapporo, the capital
of the Hokkaido, or governmental district of
which the island of Yezo, forms a part. And,
now that we were actually nearing the centre from
which we were to operate, our plan of procedure
became a question of importance. As we rode on,
in the train, we turned it over and over. There
was one man in Yezo who could help us if he chose,
the Rev. John Batchelor. Our first plan was to
find him, he lives at Sapporo, and to enlist his interest
and sympathy if possible. If we could do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
that, all would be well. If he would not assist,
then we should have to depend upon the help of a
paternal government. We had a letter from the
Tokio government to Baron Sonoda, the Governor
of the Hokkaido. He would do what he could.
We would have to call upon him anyway and submit
our plan to him. If Mr. Batchelor should be
favorable we should trouble the Governor but little;
otherwise, we should have to ask him to back
us so strongly that the poor Ainu would feel that
they must go to St. Louis, <em>willy nilly</em>.</p>

<p>We had gone about three-fourths of the journey
when, at Iwamizawa Junction, we saw a white
man, slender, long-bearded, with fur cap, boots
and long cape-coat, waiting, with his wife, on the
platform, to board the train. They entered the
car next to us, where he left lady and luggage,
and then again stepped out upon the station platform,
where he walked up and down. He seemed
to know every guard and employe at the station
and talked with all in Japanese. Seeing us, he
casually spoke to us. Having answered his question,
I said to him, “I believe you are the man for
whom I am looking and the one man who can help
me in my enterprise. I suspect you are the Rev.
John Batchelor?” My surmise was quite right,
but Mr. Batchelor, being an Englishman, is socially
cautious, and at once became quite reticent.
Before we reached Sapporo, we had laid the case
fully before him and he was evidently interested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
He was, however, non-committal and desired me
to see the Governor before he should promise his
assistance. We were not more than half convinced
that we should win his favor, but, two days
later, after he had thought the matter over and
Baron Sonoda had given us his endorsement, Mr.
Batchelor cast in his lot with us most heartily and
all was then plain sailing. Indeed there were <em>no</em>
difficulties; things were disappointingly easy—because,
after all, we enjoy some hardship and opposition!
Japanese boys are taught that they should
be like the carp and swim <em>against</em> the stream; it is
good for them. But we had no chance to be like
carp.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The Rev. John Batchelor came to Yezo in 1879,
a young man of twenty-four years. He has lived
here ever since—more than half his lifetime. A
clergyman of the Church of England and a missionary
of the Church Missionary Society, he labors
among both Japanese and Ainu, but considers
himself particularly called to be the Apostle to the
Ainu. He knows this people as no other stranger,
Japanese or “foreigner,” does. He has visited
their villages in all parts of the island; he speaks
their language more perfectly than their own young
people do; he has studied their life, and thought,
and fancies. He is their friend and adviser in
need and trouble. While his converts among
them may number nine hundred, his acquaintance
and influence extends to thousands. He has actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
lived for years in their villages, especially
Piratori and Horobets. He has written a Dictionary
and a Grammar of the Ainu language and
has translated the Psalms, the New Testament,
several Bible narratives, etc., into it; he is the author
of the two best books upon their life and
thought—<cite>The Ainu of Japan</cite> and <cite>The Ainu and
Their Folk-lore</cite>. In mission work, he is wise.
He feels that mere number of confirmations counts
for little and has often refused to confirm applicants,
rather than run risk of bringing contempt
upon the name of church member. He works to
improve and to elevate; not, to “kill the Ainu that
is in you.” Recognizing the fearful ravages
caused among this simple people by drink, he has
organized and labors to sustain an Ainu temperance
society. He supports what he calls a
“rest-house,” built on his premises at Sapporo,
where any Ainu who is sick or troubled can come
and stay until cured or assisted. Sometimes as
many as twenty are housed there. They are supplied
foodstuffs, which they prepare for themselves.
While they stay, they are expected, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
able, not only to do their own work but to help in
the garden, or at the woodpile, or about the house.</p>

<p>It was at Mr. Batchelor’s home that we saw our
first Ainu. His driver, Parapita, is a fine type.
With his long grayish hair, his great gray beard,
his kindly expression, his graceful salutations, his
neat and simple dress, his ready service, the old
man greatly pleased us. Another patriarch, working
at the woodpile, was venerable and typical, but
was mentally a little unsound; he was but a visitor
at the rest-house. Two young men, Yazo and
Goro, we shall know better bye and bye. All of
the Ainu women at the house had long, black,
wavy hair hanging down upon their shoulders
and bore the great blue-green tattoo around the
lips. This tattoo is quite unlike what I had imagined
from descriptions and colored photographs.
Instead of being a dull, rather dark, blue, it is a
light blue-green, or green-blue, which is vividly
fresh, even when it has been on the face for years.
So true is this, that Manuel asked at once, on seeing
it, whether it was freshly applied paint or something
more permanent. The girls and women
have pleasant, broad, open faces, and the abundant
hair, hanging loosely down at the sides onto the
shoulders, sets them off well. They are modest in
their manner and, often, bashful. It is a common
trick, especially in certain villages, for an Ainu
girl, when bashful in the presence of strangers, to
hang her head and shake it so that the hair falls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
over the whole face like a veil. But, for all this
modest concealment, their handsome dark eyes are
watching from beneath the sheet of hair and seeing
all that goes on outside.</p>

<p>Mr. Fujimura, the Hokkaido government’s
Fishery Expert, who speaks excellent English,
took us to see the Museum of the district. It is
fairly good in the Zoology and Geology of the
Hokkaido. The upper floor is devoted mainly to
Ethnography and, naturally, most of the specimens
are from the Ainu. The collection is not so large
nor so complete as it should be, nor is it particularly
well arranged. There are examples of the
mattings, the bark cloth, articles of dress, ornaments,
weapons, and implements, of Ainu of several
villages. There is a series of wooden war-clubs,
apparently of recent manufacture, from near
Muroran, which shows a considerable variety in
form. These clubs are now rarely found in the
villages and originals cannot be easily secured.
An entire case is devoted to the cups, tubs, moustache
sticks, implements, and <em>inao</em> used in the bear-feast,
but they merely suggest what <em>might</em> be done
in the making of such a display. One of the most
interesting objects in the Ainu collection is a grave-post
from the Island of Saghalien, quite different
in its form and carved decoration from those made
by the Yezo Ainu. It is made from the forking
trunk of a small tree and a considerable part of
the available surface is covered with carved, apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
geometric, designs. The old man who
conducts visitors through the Museum is little likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
to permit anyone to escape, without seeing a
great, stuffed, brown bear, which killed and ate
three persons. Parts of one of the victims, a little
baby, taken from its stomach, are preserved in a
bottle of alcohol.</p>

<p>We started out on Monday, February 22, legal
holiday at home, for our hasty trip through the
Ainu villages of the Saru River district, to secure
our group of Ainu. We had already decided to
take Yazo (Ozara Fukotaro) and his wife, Shirake
from Mr. Batchelor’s house. As already
familiar with white people and their customs, we
felt that they would be a good influence in keeping
others satisfied. Yazo has lived with Mr. Batchelor
since he was fourteen years old, now a matter
of ten years. He is industrious and progressive
and has a little farm, some horses, etc. While we
were gone, he went out to his village to make arrangements
for the care of his place and property,
while he should be away. His wife, Shirake, is
a pretty and attractive girl of eighteen years, timid
and modest.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>We went on the railroad, back toward Muroran,
leaving the train at Tomakomai, about midway
between Sapporo and Muroran. Mr. Batchelor
had telegraphed ahead and a <em>basha</em> was waiting
for us at the station. A <em>basha</em> is a queer, little,
four-wheeled, covered cart, drawn by two of the
small and shaggy Japanese horses. A cross-seat
in front serves for the driver, and two lengthwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>seats within are for passengers, who enter the
vehicle from behind by a single, central, iron step.
The <em>basha</em> is expected to carry six passengers, three
on each seat, and the fare is charged for six,
whether there is a single person or a full load.
By the time we three were in, with our lunch basket,
camera, luggage, etc., it would have been difficult
for others to have found a place. Though
it was chilly, the snow was thawing and before we
had gone far, we really had no snow at all. From
the station, we struck straight for the sea, riding
over a low, flat, country, chiefly grass-grown,
though with trees here and there. As we neared
the coast, the road became actually sandy. From
the open end of the <em>basha</em>, behind us, we had fine
views of the pretty volcano Tarumai. The air
was clear and the graceful, white-covered, mountain
stood sharply against the sky. A great deal
of vapor was escaping from it and the constant
changes in the form and size of the white clouds
of it, that hung at the crater until blown away,
were curious to watch. When we reached the sea
we turned abruptly to the left, losing the volcano
view, and rode in long straight stretches, parallel
to the coast, behind and below the line of low
dunes. We passed, now and again, little groups
of fishing huts and miniature <em>torii</em>, gateways to
wee Shinto shrines. We reached Yubutsu, where
we dismounted and walked along the sandy coast
to stretch our legs and warm our bodies. When,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>after changing horses, the <em>basha</em> came along again,
we remounted. At Azuma we spent the night in
a Japanese inn, where Mr. Batchelor has a European
room and a stove. His lunch-basket pieced
out our supper, as it did all our subsequent meals,
in a marvellous way. Azuma was full of soldiers
as “the reserves” were being called out and this
was a local gathering place.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>When we started in the morning, the wind was
cold and we walked a little to start the circulation.
For some time after we entered the <em>basha</em>, our
road continued over a plain covered with dry yellow
grass, with oak trees, scattered or in clumps,
here and there. Little or no snow lay on the
ground. The general impression of the winter
landscape was dreary and desolate. At Mukawa,
we changed horses and <em>basha</em>, and found ourselves
nearing the line of hills, which we had long seen
ahead. At Sarabuto, where we first reached the
Saru River, we turned left, leaving the sea and
the low country and striking straight for the hills.
We soon passed near the Ainu village of Shumunkot,
and close by the side of the road saw a place
where five Ainu had been buried. Such burial
places are usually in out-of-the-way spots, and are
neglected and avoided. There were no graves
raised over the dead and the area was overgrown
with brush. That there were three men, one
woman and one girl, was shown by the stakes
marking the graves. These were small trunks or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
large branches of trees with the bark left on. For
a man’s grave, the upper end of the stake is cut
to a spear-point or paddle-tip; for a woman’s, the
upper end is rounded and pierced so as to present
a loop or a half ring. The grave-stake for a child
is smaller than that of an adult.</p>

<br>

<p>Here we were again near an Ainu town, Nina,
and from here on we were in a forest, frequently
on uneven or rolling land, and in the midst of
actual winter, with plenty of snow all around us.
Presently we came to a considerable Ainu town,
Lower Piratori, so called because lower on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Saru River than Upper Piratori. It is well characterized,
typical of the Saru River villages. A
single street runs through the place; the houses
lie in one long line on the east of this street, while
the storehouses, set high up, each on four posts,
to keep the contents out of reach of animals, are to
the west of it. We paid particular attention to
the orientation of the houses, because Hitchcock
thinks that it is a matter of no consequence. At
Lower Piratori, and at all the other Ainu towns we
visited, the house is placed east and west; at the
east end is the sacred window; the main doorway,
at the western end, is generally not visible, being
sheltered by a little approach, shelter or shed,
known as the <em>shem</em>, the doorway in which opens
south. In this <em>shem</em> the millet mortar and pestle,
agricultural implements, etc., are stored. The
east window and the west doorway are often the
only openings from the rectangular, single-roomed
house, but there may be a south door and also a
south window. The Ainu house is rectangular;
the ridgepole runs lengthwise and the roof is two-pitched.
The framework of the house consists of
tree-trunk uprights and pole cross-pieces, all lashed
together with cords or strips of bark; the walls are
of rushes and mattings and the roof is a heavy
thatch. In building the house the roof is first constructed
and then lifted and placed upon the corner
posts.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">AINU VILLAGE: OSATNAI.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>In the centre of the room is the open fireplace—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
rectangular space, marked out with boards set on
edge. There is no chimney for the escape of
smoke. The floor may be covered with mats,
which are made by the women. The different
members of the household have their individual
places in the house. The east end of the fireplace
is honorable and when a guest arrives to whom
great respect is due, a box is set in this place of
honor, a fine mat with decorative patterns woven
into it is folded and laid upon it, and he is invited
to sit down. The sleeping places along the walls
are sometimes separated from each other by suspended
mats. The inside wall is often hung with
mats, partly as a decoration and finish and partly
to cut off draughts. Over the fireplace hangs a
kettle in which food is boiled; it is suspended by
a wooden pothook, which has an ingenious, though
simple, mode of adjustment whereby it can be
lowered or raised. In the northeast corner of the
house are the “treasures,” varying of course with
the householder. There are great tubs for saké,
cylindrical vessels with lids; they measure a foot
or two in height by about a foot across, are of
Japanese manufacture and are usually black lacquer
with gilding. They were presented long ago
to the ancestors, maybe by Japanese officials, and
are prized heirlooms. There are also lacquer
saké cups or bowls, of various sizes and shapes,
but also Japanese gifts and heirlooms. On the
wall are hung sword-sheaths with hilts in place;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>generally there are no blades within, whether because
these have been disposed of, or because the
Japanese givers thought best not to supply the
enemy real weapons, we do not know. All these
cups and tubs and swords make a great show, although
they are all heavy with the accumulated
smoke and dirt of years. Beside these treasures
of Japanese origin one sees also objects of native
workmanship—knife sheaths (with and without
knives) and wooden quivers, some of which contain
arrows, even old arrows with the famous
poison on them.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Outside, to the east of the sacred window and
at a little distance, is the <em>nusa</em>, or “sacred hedge,”
a line or group of willow sticks set in the ground,
from the upper ends of which hang curls of shavings,
usually shaved from the sticks themselves.
Such shaved sticks, called <em>inao</em>, play an important
part in the life and religion of the Ainu. The
<em>nusa</em> is sacred and strangers should not meddle
with it or with single <em>inao</em>, nor pass between the
<em>nusa</em> and the east window. Nor ought people to
look in through the east window or throw things
out from the house through it. <em>Inao</em> are also used
inside the house. The one of chief importance
stands in the very northeast corner of the house
and ought never to be removed from its place.
Even shaving curls, cut completely from their
stick have their value and are tied to, wrapped
about, or laid upon, articles in the treasure corner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span><em>Inao</em> are also set up by the springs of water, by
the storehouses, and even near the outhouses or
places of relief. In all these cases, they serve as
guardians or charms with magic power.</p>

<br>

<p>We did not tarry long at Lower Piratori, but
continued our journey to Upper Piratori, which is
close by. In fact, formerly, there was a continuous
village but a migration of the middle part of
the town has left the extremes separated and now
they bear distinct names. The little Japanese inn
is in the centre of Upper Piratori and we were soon
comfortably installed. Piratori is, of all Ainu
towns, the best known to the outside world and
many travelers—Miss Bird, Landor, Fincke,—have
described it and pictured its chief, old Penri.
The old man died in December last. When Mr.
Batchelor first came to Piratori, years ago, he lived
in Penri’s house, having the southeast corner partitioned
off for his use. Here he began to study
the language and to collect the materials for his
dictionary. The old house still stands, though
now occupied by a Japanese family, and we photographed
it, with Mr. Batchelor near the south
doorway, in memory of old times. At the time
of his death, Penri lived in another house, which
we visited. The widow, on seeing us began to
weep, in token of her bereavement; this she would
be expected to do, on first seeing a friend after her
husband’s death, even if a much longer time had
passed after the event. Somewhat to our surprise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>she let us take away an <em>inao</em> placed at the west
door in connection with the funeral and mourning.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p029_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">NUSA: NEPTANI.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>At a neighboring house we were greatly impressed
by the dignified appearance of two men
seated at the fireplace, father and son. The older,
a brother of Penri, had long gray hair and beard;
the younger, was of somewhat stouter build and
had abundant long black hair and a full black
beard. As we entered, and the old man saw who
we were, he rose without a word, found his crown
and placed it on his head; both then proceeded to
salute us. We had already seen something of
these strange and dignified greetings, but this was
our first experience of the thing at home. They
sat for some time slowly rubbing their hands together,
back and forth, the palms being vertical;
after doing this, they separated the hands outward
to the sides, palms upward, and then raised and
lowered them two or three times, as if balancing
or weighing something, each time raising them
higher and nearer to the beard; finally they brought
the hands to the beard and stroked it from the
sides. There are then, really three parts to this
salutation, after the performance of which the conversation
began.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">PENRI’S OLD HOUSE: UPPER PIRATORI.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>These crowns worn ceremoniously by the men
are really interesting; they consist of a foundation
band of cloth or woven work that fits around the
head. To this, in front, there is a bear’s head
carved in wood; this is replaced sometimes, as at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>Shiraoi, by bear claws; sometimes the carved head
of an eagle or a hawk replaces the bear’s head.
From the band of the crown hang several—often
six—little square flaps of cloth. These are the
“hair” of the crown which also has a “body”
and “bones.” A. Henry Savage-Landor, often
unreliable, calls these strange head-dresses “regal
crowns.” Of course there is nothing “regal”
about them. They are worn at joyful festivals or
on other pleasant occasions,—such as our visit!—and
may be worn only by <em>well-to-do</em> and <em>good</em> men.</p>

<p>Among Ainu the woman is regarded as an inferior
and generally she acquiesces pleasantly
enough in the assumption. At festivals, the men
sit in a line in front, near the drinking cups; the
women sit behind and receive what their lords
please to give them after they have had what they
want. The woman usually wears a band of cloth
around her head. On meeting a man, in greeting
him, she respectfully removes this and hangs it
upon her left arm; she then draws her right hand
over her upper lip, from the left to the right; she
may then pat the hair at the sides of her head, with
her hands. The movement of drawing her hand
across her lip is common when she has received a
favor and seems to be an expression of thanks and
pleasure.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">AINU GROUP: FEAST OCCASION.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>We had planned to photograph during the afternoon
but it snowed heavily—as it did every
afternoon, while we were in the villages—so we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>visited from house to house and then waited at the
inn, for those who, at Mr. Batchelor’s suggestion,
brought in wares and treasures for sale. As these
articles were everywhere practically the same, we
may as well describe them once for all in connection
with Piratori. For a long time back, as
shown by old pictures, the Ainu dress has been
much like that of their Japanese neighbors.
There are, however, some articles of dress that
are truly Ainu and even when Japanese stuffs and
patterns are used the decoration may be characteristic.
The women make a coarse, brown, thread,
from elm-bark fibre, which is called <em>attus</em>. This
they weave, using a simple loom, into a strong and
durable cloth, which, however, becomes brittle if
too dry. This may be woven solidly in the natural
color, or stripes of blue, (black or white,)
threads may be woven into it. From such cloth,
single piece garments, much like the Japanese <em>kimono</em>,
with short sleeves tapering at the end, are
made for both men and women; there is little, if
any real, difference in form in those for the two
sexes and both are folded and held in position,
by a band at the waist, in the same way. Upon
these garments, whether made of <em>attus</em> cloth or of
Japanese cottons, the women embroider elaborate
patterns in colored threads. On the whole the
garments for men are more ornamented than those
for women. The patterns are said to differ somewhat
from district to district. The designs consist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of curious combinations of straight lines and
graceful curves. In their irregular forms and
symmetrical arrangements, one would hardly think
that original animal designs might be hidden.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
There is no question, however, that some of these
apparently meaningless, simply fanciful, designs
are conventionalizations of the bear’s head and it
is possible that all of them might, by careful study,
be traced back to some such origin. Both men
and women wear leggings wrapped about the leg
from the knee down, which are made of <em>attus</em>, or
of Japanese blue stuffs, and are often decorated
with the curved-line embroideries. Around the
neck, women wear a closely-fitting, narrow band
of velvet, with a little flap at the middle; upon this
flap, which hangs in front when the band is adjusted,
is a round piece of silver or german silver
upon which an ornamental design is engraved.
Both sexes wear earrings, but the old men seem
particularly fond of great hoop-earrings, two
inches or more across, which are sometimes of silver
but more likely of some cheaper material.
Women delight in necklaces and often carry several
pounds of large beads around the neck; these
beads are rarely of bright glass, being generally of
dull colors and of some porcelanous material.
We had supposed these beads to be of Japanese
origin but are told that most of them came from
Manchuria. In any event, the heavy strings of
beads are, generally, heirlooms and it is probably
a long time since new supplies of them have been
sold or exchanged to the Ainu. Frequently,
square-pierced “cash” are strung in with the beads
and a disk or other pendant of metal hangs from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the necklace. While the woman is often content
with any cloth to tie around her head, she sometimes
weaves a special head-band of decorative
character.</p>

<p>Ainu babies, like Japanese, are often carried on
the backs of older children, who are themselves
little more than babies. The modes of carrying
are, however, quite different. The Japanese baby
is bound in place and the loose over-garment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the little nurse is then put on so as to cover both
baby and carrier; the Ainu baby, sometimes seated
on a little stick, is carried by means of a carry-strap,
<em>tara</em>, very like those in use among American
Indians, which passes across the forehead of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
bearer. Not only babies, but all sorts of burdens
are carried with the <em>tara</em>.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">JAPANESE AND AINU CHILDREN CARRYING BABIES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The face tattoo of Ainu women has already
been mentioned. It is begun in childhood, a small
round spot being made at the middle of the upper
lip. It is not done by pricking with points as Japanese
tattooing is, but by cutting with a knife.
Soot from the bottom of the kettle is rubbed into
the cut lines and a decoction of ash bark is washed
on to fix the color, which, as already stated, is a
blue-green. The tattooing is gradually developed,
until, when the girl is ready for marriage, the
whole, great, moustache-like mark is fully done.
It completely surrounds the mouth, covering both
the upper and lower lip, and even extends onto the
mucous membrane surface. The hands and the
arms to the elbows are also tattooed with a system
of rings, dots, zigzags, etc., which appear to be
largely individual.</p>

<p>In the Ainu house, furniture in our sense of the
word is largely lacking. Mattings are used for
wall-hangings, carpeting, seats and beds. In the
<em>shem</em> are the mortar and pestle for pounding millet.
The mortar is hollowed out from a section of
a tree trunk; the pestle is heavy, with a head at
each end. Women do the pounding, often two
of them working together, dealing alternate blows,
and singing wordless songs to give time to the
blows. There is a variety of bowls and platters,
trays, stirrers, ladles, and spoons, cut from wood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
some plain and some decorated with ornamental
carved designs. Also cut from wood, are pounders,
pothooks, suspended cradles, sticks for the
baby to sit on when carried, troughs for feeding
bears from, and the different parts of the simple
loom. There are two kinds of native devices for
lighting—a torch consisting of a cleft-stick with
a folded bit of birch-bark stuck into the cleft and a
lamp made of a pecten shell, as a receiver for oil,
set up on a crotched stick. The shell of the pecten
also makes a good scoop for dipping out the dinner
from the common pot—we have the one that
old Parapita used to use at home—and at Shiraoi,
we found the great shell lashed to a stick handle,
for use as a ladle. Trays and bowls, scoops and
ladles are also neatly made from pieces of bark.
Agricultural implements are crude. A bent stick
serves as a grub or hoe, while poor spades may be
cut from wood. A long and narrow fresh-water
mussel shell is the sickle with which grain is cut,
only the head being removed, while the whole
length of the straw remains standing in the field.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the Ainu would prefer to
remain hunters and fishermen. Their mountains
abounded in deer and bears and the waters of Yezo
swarmed with salmon and other fish. The Ainu
had devised a series of ingenious traps and weapons.
To-day they have guns, but bows are also
somewhat used, though poisoned arrows are a
thing of the past—thanks to Japanese laws.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>The Ainu bow is a single, simple, stick of yew; the
bowstring is a cord of bark fibre. The poisoned
arrow was an ingenious affair. The foundation
of the poison was aconite secured from the corm
of the plant; to this various other ingredients were
added. Not everyone knew how to compound
the poison and to-day the knowledge is possessed
by few. The point of the arrow was rather large
and broad and was hollowed out on one side; a
wad of the poison was pressed into this hollow and
then set in place with gum. The Ainu hunter,
besides his bows and arrows, spears and clubs, had
his hunting knife and knew well how to use it in
close encounters with bears. He still uses it and
always carries it, sheathed in an elaborately carved
wooden case, upon his person.</p>

<p>At Upper Piratori is the “shrine of Yoshitsune.”
This famous Japanese hero of the 12th
century, according to a doubtful tradition, escaped
his pursuing enemies and sought refuge in Yezo,
where he was greatly respected by the Ainu, among
whom he lived the remainder of his life. Upon
the height behind the upper end of the village,
there is a little shrine, which contains an ugly figure
of a Japanese warrior, said to be Yoshitsune.
Miss Bird describes the “worship” of this figure
by the Ainu. The shrine and the figure are both
purely Japanese. Who put them where they are,
or when, or why, we cannot say. If the figure is
respected by the Ainu of the village, it has had but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
little influence on their religious thought. It is
aught except “the great god of the mountain
Ainu.” If we had had more time or if it had
been summer, we would have visited it. As it
was we cared more to look at Ainu <em>inao</em> and <em>nusa</em>.</p>

<p>Miss Bryant, an Australian lady, lives at Upper
Piratori as the local missionary of the C. M. S.
She speaks Ainu and has a household of Ainu girls.
She was good enough to invite us in the evening
to take coffee and delicious cakes. She showed us
some embroideries her girls had made in colored
silks on cottons. The materials are Japanese and
she supplies these to the girls. The designs are
left to them. The stitching is well done and is as
neat and even as machine work; it is hard to think
that the better pieces were done by hand. Mrs.
Batchelor, at Sapporo, also allows the Ainu girls
in her house to do such needlework. From the
sale of such pieces to travelers the girls gain a little
money for themselves.</p>

<br>

<p>We had thought to pursue our further journey
with sleds, but these failed to appear and we started
off on foot. As carriers of our luggage we
hired a married couple, of whom the woman appeared
to be far the better man. At all events,
she took the heavier <em>kore</em> (basket-trunk) and
started off the more gaily. Both used the <em>tara</em>,
or carry-strap passing across the forehead, in carrying
their loads. We at once crossed the Saru
River on the ice. It is here a broad stream, flowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
between low terraces, back of which rise fine
hills. We tramped steadily through a forest, over
a somewhat rolling country, and at the end of an
hour found ourselves at Neptani. Here we saw
our first evidence of a bear-feast. To the east of
one house was a <em>nusa</em>, upon the middle <em>inao</em> of
which was fastened a bear’s head with the ears
and skin yet on. Between the house and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
<em>nusa</em> was a post, with a tuft of green at the top,
to which the bear had been tied, and we could see,
below the east window, the newly repaired wall,
showing where the old one had been broken down
at the time of the celebration. We saw plenty of
similar trophy <em>nusas</em> and other evidences of bear
feasts later, but nowhere were we so fortunate as
to find the feast in progress—nor did we anywhere
see living bears in the villages. There
were cages everywhere but all the bears had been
killed.</p>

<p>As the bear feast is the most important Ainu
ceremonial and one of the strangest customs of
this strange people, we will describe it from the
observations of others.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Bear-hunting takes place in the late winter and
early spring. In these hunts the Ainu often show
great courage and intrepidity. The bear is a
large, brown species, near, if not identical with,
the grizzly bear. When one is killed it is ceremoniously
treated. Salutations and apologies are
made to the body. It is then skinned and the
head and skin are laid out and decorated with ribbons,
<em>inao</em> shavings, etc. Feasting ensues and the
whole occasion is one of joy and gaiety. But this
is <em>not</em> the “bear-feast.” When on these bear-hunts,
the Ainu are particularly anxious to capture
a little bear cub, which is taken home alive, and
given over to a woman for raising. There has
been much debate over the question whether she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
suckles it as she would her baby. It has often
been affirmed that she does and has often been
denied. When Mr. Batchelor wrote <cite>The Ainu of
Japan</cite>, he was anxious not to admit the claim.
Since then, however, he has actually seen the little
animal suckled by women, several times. On one
occasion, when he was preaching in a house, the
little cub was taken into the service and was passed
from one woman to another and suckled, in the
most matter-of-fact way. Later on, though no
longer suckled, the pet bear is most carefully fed;
sometimes the woman will give it a soft morsel
with her lips. When the animal is too large to
be longer kept in the house and petted, it is put
out into the cage, constructed of a cob-work of
logs and raised a little above the ground on posts.
In feeding it there, a special wooden trough with a
handle is used. Formerly the bear was kept two
or three years in the village; now one rarely sees a
bear more than a year old in the cages. Finally
the time for the great ceremonial arrives. Food
and drink are prepared in large quantities—millet
cakes or dumplings, millet beer, and saké
(Japanese rice brandy). Guests from other villages
are invited. Everyone is dressed in their
finest clothing. The older and more important
men wear their crowns. The men have bathed
and their foreheads and the back of their necks
have been shaved and their hair trimmed; bathing,
shaving and hair trimming regularly occur but once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>a year. Abundance of fresh <em>inao</em> are cut. A
preliminary feasting takes place, at which the men
seat themselves in a semi-circle to the east of the
house, facing the <em>nusa</em>, near the food and drink,
which are placed before them; the women sit behind
the men. Presently a man, chosen for that
service, goes to the bear’s cage, where he salaams
and makes an address to the captive. Mr. Batchelor
prints one such address, as follows: “Oh
thou divine one, thou wast sent into the world for
us to hunt. Oh, thou precious little divinity, we
worship thee; pray hear our prayer. We have
nourished thee and brought thee up with a deal
of pains and trouble, all because we love thee so.
Now, as thou hast grown big, we are about to send
thee to thy father and mother. When thou comest
to them please speak well of us, and tell them
how kind we have been; please come to us again
and we will sacrifice thee.” Two young men, one
on either side, now noose the bear with lassoes and
drag him out among the people. Armed with
bows and peculiar arrows, with blunt, wooden
points, they shoot at him to tease and irritate him.
Such arrows are not used on any other occasion,
and the tips are stained black after which ornamental
patterns are cut through, to show the white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
wood beneath; a bit of red flannel is added at the
very tip. After being led around for some time,
the animal is tied to a stout stake driven into the
ground, and the teasing continues. Finally, two
young men attack the animal, one seizing it by
the ears and head, the other taking it by the hind
quarters; a third man rushes up holding a stick by
the ends in his hands and forces it between the
bear’s teeth; four other men seize the animal by
his legs or feet and drag them outward until the
bear lies sprawling upon the ground. Two long
poles are then placed, one on the ground under the
bear’s throat, the other across the nape of his neck.
Upon these the people crowd and weigh down to
strangle the poor beast. Sometimes a man with
a bow and arrow shortens the creature’s sufferings
by a well-directed shot. The bear is then skinned
and its head is cut off, the skin remaining attached
to it. The skin and head are then laid out upon
a nice mat near the east window, and decorated
with <em>inao</em> shavings, beads, earrings, small mirrors,
etc.; a bit of its own flesh is placed under its snout;
dried fish, saké or millet beer, millet dumplings,
and a cup of its own meat boiled are offered to it.
A worshiper addresses it in some such fashion as
this: “Oh, cub, we give you these <em>inao</em>, cakes,
and dried fish; take them to your parents and say,
‘I have been brought up for a long time by an
Ainu father and mother and have been kept from
all trouble and harm; as I am now grown big, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
am come to thee. I have also brought you these
<em>inao</em>, cakes, and dried fish. Please rejoice.’ If
you say this to them, they will be very glad.”
Dancing and feasting then ensue. A cup of the
animal’s flesh has meantime been boiled; after this
has been offered to him, a little is given to every
person present, even the children. A general feast
upon the meat of the bear follows, until practically
nothing is left except his bones. The head with
its skin attached is then placed upon the <em>nusa</em> and
left there. In time, through decay and weathering,
only the bleached skull remains. Sometimes,
a <em>nusa</em> will bear great numbers of these skulls. At
Shiraoi, we later saw some <em>nusas</em> that had four or
five, but we have not seen any of the great trophies,
such as are figured in some books.</p>

<p>While the bear-feast is the greatest ceremonial
of the year, it is not absolutely different from some
others. Birds of various kinds,—especially the
great eagle, hawk, and owl,—and other animals,—as
the hare or rabbit—are sacrificed or “sent
away,” in much the same way, often after having
been kept in captivity for a longer or shorter time.</p>

<p>The island of Yezo is unlike the rest of Japan,
in geology, in fauna, and in flora. It is a continental
island, continuing in its structure and rock
formations the neighboring mainland, although it
is an active volcanic area and presents some modern
eruptive rocks. The island is remarkably
compact and presents the least coast line to square
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>mile of surface of any part of the Japanese Empire.
It presents the finest forests and the broadest
plains of Japan, and its Ishikari is the longest
Japanese river. Its coal mines are extensive and
there are other sources of mineral wealth. In its
fauna and flora the island is remarkably like the
Eastern United States—not merely in general
aspect, but in identity of species. Yezo, with its
immediately neighboring islands, presents an area
of 30,273 square miles, about that of South Carolina.
Until recently, it has been occupied by the
Ainu. As Russian aggression has been more and
more feared by Japan, it became plain that Yezo,
with its unaggressive population of Ainu, was a
weak spot, unprotected and easily attacked, which
needed to be strengthened. A policy of colonization
was developed. To colonize wisely, demanded
study and experiment. A geological survey
was made, experimental farms were established,
an agricultural college was founded, roads
were built, towns were planted, industries were
originated. Much of this work of development
was placed in the hands of Americans, some of
whom did nobly, while others betrayed their trust
or failed through incapacity. Immigration was
encouraged from the older and more crowded parts
of the Empire. Towns, and even cities, have
grown up in a few years; everything is new; life
is much as that of our pioneer days and frontier
settlements. All this is undoubtedly good for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>Japan as a nation, but it is hard upon the Ainu.
In 1874 Yezo numbered 144,069 inhabitants, of
whom 16,000 were Ainu; in 1899, the population
was 859,534, the Ainu being reported at 17,000.
This flood of Japanese immigration is largely
homesteaders; each year sees the Ainu more directly
in contact with Japanese neighbors and less
secure in the little villages which he occupies. Such
thoughts as these about the island home of the
Ainu suggested themselves to our minds as we
trudged over the snow through the forests.</p>

<p>But our walking neared its end. At Neptani we
arranged for a sledge and then started on, leaving
it to overtake us. Just as we left the village, we
overtook a hunting party on its way to the mountains
for deer. The men of the party came from
two or three different villages; they carried the
guns, and led the dogs; the women carried the
luggage. The dogs were like coyotes in size and
form and some of them were brown-gray in color;
there was, however, considerable range in color.
They were strangers to one another and quarrelsome,
and probably several days had to elapse before
they became friendly. Having exchanged
greetings with the hunters and photographed the
group, we journeyed on. From here the country
was more broken, the terrace slope being cut by lateral
gorges, opening on the Saru, which was still to
our left. Before long, we were overtaken by our
sled, the driver of which was a typical young fellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>of some twenty-two years, beardless, indeed,
but with long hair hanging, from a central parting,
down upon his shoulders. Before we reached
the next village, we met a man from Okotnai,
whither we were bound, who told us that the man,
of whom we were in search, had gone hunting.
This was a dash to our hopes, for we had counted
on securing him for our group. He was no doubt
already in the mountains beyond our reach and not
likely to return for a fortnight or more. The
hunting party which we had photographed was
still in sight and their leader had greatly pleased
us. Asking whether we cared for him, Mr.
Batchelor called him back. He told him that we
wished him, with his wife and child, to go with
us to the United States; that he would be gone nine
months; that he should go. A look of blank helplessness
came over his face, but he replied that he
would have to go, of course, if <em>he</em> said so. I now
found for the first time—because the type is
really very uniform, and all men of an age look
alike—that he was the younger of the two men
whom we had seen in the first home we visited in
Upper Piratori—Kutoroge, the nephew of old
Penri. This recognition recalled the older man
and we suggested to Mr. Batchelor, the wish that
he, too, might be secured. “Oh, yes, Kutoroge,
the gentleman wants an old man, a graybeard, who
knows how to make the arrow poison and to whittle
the <em>inao</em>. Can you not find him such a man?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
“Why, sir, there is my old father, you know!
Would he not do? And really, if we must <em>die</em>, it
is better that we should die together than separated.”
“Oh, yes,” we answered, “so there <em>is</em>
your father! Well, go back to your village, and
tell him and make preparation, so that all may be
ready when we come back to-morrow.” He
agreed, but would have to go on to the next village
to overtake his wife, who had gone on with the
luggage, while we were talking. Thus a hunting
party was left without its leader!</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">CROSSING A STREAM IN WINTER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Passing Penakori, traveling through a fine hill
district, for the most part wooded, near Porosaru,
we came to a little stream which was open and
which we had to cross by a dugout canoe. The
ferryman was an old man, with fine hair and beard.
He was dressed in native garments, which were
old and worn. Though the weather was cold,
his breast was uncovered and showed an unusually
thick growth of body hair. The old man first
poled us over, then brought our luggage and the
box body of the sled. The driver, mounting the
little horse, forded him across, dragging the runners.
After we had reconstructed the sled and
loaded in the baggage, we rode on through the
forest, over the uneven terrace, until at last we
descended to the Saru River. It was open, and
projecting fringes of ice reached out from the shore
over the water in a way that looked dangerous.
However, we crept out on them, expecting them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
break and let us into the water, to another canoe,
poled this time by a strong, young ferryman. We
crossed safely and crept out onto similar projecting
ice fringes on the other side. Our driver tried
to make a crossing at a ford higher up the river,
but failed. Meantime we followed the river bottom
for some little distance, over soft and water-soaked
snow, that let us sink deeply every two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
or three steps; finally, however, we mounted to the
low terrace where the walking improved and were
soon in the village of Osatnai. From there it was
but a fifteen-minutes’ walk to Okotnai, last of this
group of Saru Ainu towns and the goal of our
journey. From Tomakomai, where we left the
railroad, we had traveled in the three days some
eighteen <em>ri</em>, equal to about forty-five miles, distributed

<p>It was just after noon when we arrived, going
directly to Tunkamareg’s house. He had really
gone hunting, but Charenga, his wife, was at home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and we were made welcome. Two families live
in the house, each with two or three children.
Tunkamareg and Charenga are both Ainu; the
other man is Ainu, but his wife is Japanese and
the little mongrel children were not much to my
taste. We were cold and tired and hungry. The
pot was boiling and we put some chicken that we
had brought with us from Piratori in with the millet
that the house supplied, and were soon eating
our first Ainu meal. It was now snowing hard
outside and we hugged the fire all the afternoon,
while the villagers brought in all kinds of articles
for sale. During the afternoon fresh venison was
brought in and our evening stew was rice (secured
somewhere, somehow) and deer-meat. It was interesting
to watch the children of the two families
quarrel over a deer-bone, fresh and bloody, which
they took turns in sucking and in picking off shreds
of raw meat. This house, though a true Ainu
hut, is mission headquarters, and under outside
influences a corner of it has been walled off into
a sleeping room for Tunkamareg and his wife.
This room Charenga surrendered to us for the
night. In it was one of Mr. Batchelor’s little
stoves, but it smoked badly; the night was cold
and the room draughty, yet on the whole we were
more comfortable when the fire went out. All
night we suffered from the bitter cold.</p>

<br>

<p>We were up early and left betimes. The only
sled that could be secured was too small to do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>more than take our baggage, increased as it was
by purchases! So we walked. Mr. Batchelor,
more accustomed to this exercise and to Japan’s
atmosphere and with little on his bones to carry,
kept up a lively pace; Manuel did fairly; but the
“leader” of the expedition played out completely
before he reached Porosaru, by which time the
party was strung out in three sections, along a
couple of miles or so of road. It was with joy
that he finally met an Ainu boy, with a little sled
for dragging wood, who bore a written message
stating that he was in our employ! At Porosaru
the party was reunited and we made a visit of ceremony
at the rather large house of an Ainu of consequence.
We entered through the south door and
were seated upon handsome mattings, which were
folded and laid upon boxes at the east end of the
fireplace. Here we photographed the interior of
the hut, but our negative was bad; it was a pity,
for the northeast corner full of treasures was fine.
We had better success in photographing a Japanese
lacquered tray, upon which, wrapped in <em>inao</em>
shavings, were three skulls—those of an otter, a
fox, and an albatross.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Our driver, acting under instructions, had hurried
on to Neptani, where he had aroused the village,
making an especial search for moustache
sticks, with designs in high relief. His search
had been rewarded and we carried away two—both,
unfortunately, lacquered, but well made.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>One of them bore the figure of a bear in full relief
about an inch high, in front of which was a swimming
whale; the other bore three mountains. He
had other things awaiting inspection, too—fine
dresses, necklaces, swords, and scabbards, carved
tobacco-boxes, and the like. We took in a rich
harvest, but what pleased us most after the two
moustache sticks, was a fine fetish bird-skull
wrapped in <em>inao</em> shavings. This was the third
example of its kind that we had seen. The first
was at Piratori, where the wrapped skull belonged
to a woman who was “in an interesting condition,”
and we thought it unwise to offer to make
the purchase; the second was at the house of Porosaru,
where the skulls were so carefully guarded
and apparently so highly prized, that we did not
hint at purchase; here the skull had been lately
used and we could see the spot from which bone
powder had been scraped for use as a remedy.
The house belonged to particular friends of Mr.
Batchelor, and after little demur, we carried the
skull away in triumph.</p>

<p>Perhaps the moustache lifter is peculiar to the
Ainu. At any rate, it is characteristic of them,
and upon it they lavish their utmost artistic efforts.
It is a thin, flat stick, measuring some eight, ten,
or twelve inches in length by about an inch in
width; the ends are angular, one being broadly
obtuse, almost squared, and the other sharpened
to almost a real point. The upper surface is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
carved with decorative designs, the work in some
cases being admirable. The patterns are, mostly,
curved-line conventions. Recent specimens are all
carved in low relief; some of the older ones bear
full round figures. Usually made in plain wood
of light color, they were sometimes turned over
to Japanese neighbors to be lacquered. These
curious sticks serve a double purpose; the sharper
end is dipped into saké or millet beer, and then
drops are sprinkled from it to divine beings, in
drinking, on ceremonial occasions. On such occasions
the cups of drink are set out upon the ground
before the guests, with moustache sticks laid across
them. The art of carving these sticks is now neglected
and the finer specimens are all old. The
old artist used to leave his mark cut on the under
side—some simple device, as a triangle, some
crossing lines, etc. These moustache sticks had a
great attraction for us and we secured scores of
them. Most of my finest specimens bear the same
maker’s mark, a simple, unequally impressed, solid
triangle, apparently made with a punch. While
such moustache lifters figure generally on ceremonial
occasions, there is also a special ceremonial
type. It is whittled from fresh wood; no decorative
designs are carved upon it, but rolls of shavings
are whittled up at three places on the upper
side.</p>

<p>At the house where we had stopped, lived a
paralytic. On our arrival we had dismissed our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
little wood sled and our old driver had arranged
for two good sleds with boxes. When we were
ready to start, we found we were not to be alone.
Our driver took an Ainu woman and all the luggage
into his sled; into the other, we packed a company
consisting of the driver, a fine bearded subject,
the paralytic, two women, Manuel and myself.
We expected Mr. Batchelor also, but when
he saw the prospects, he sniffed in derision and
stalked off down the road. Our driver was a fine
type, but he was stupid and careless. We were
going gaily, packed as close as sardines in a box,
when in crossing a little brook, we struck some
obstacle and were all spilled out onto the snow.
Fortunately none of us fell into the brook and no
one was hurt. We picked up the paralytic and
put him into the sled, repacked ourselves and were
off again. We soon overtook Mr. Batchelor, readjusted
the two loads, taking him in, and went
on. Before long we were again at the Saru River,
and crossing on foot, over the ice, were at Upper
Piratori at four o’clock.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>We found that the old man refused to go with
us. He was too old and frail to make so long and
difficult a journey. Kutoroge had, however,
picked out a man at Lower Piratori, whom he
had persuaded to go, taking his wife and little girl.
They were submitted to our inspection and proved
highly satisfactory. Sangyea has graying hair, a
gray beard, and a patriarchal aspect; he wears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>great hoop earrings and a well embroidered ceremonial
garment. Santukno, his wife, is charmingly
ugly, with a broad and heavy lower face,
prominent jaws, and a fine tattooing on face and
arms. She is a kind soul and suffers from a curious
nervous trouble, which they call <em>imu</em> and which
seems somewhat mysterious. Those who are
<em>imu</em> are terribly afraid of snakes, and the sight of
one, or even mention of one, throws them into a
state of rigidity. Certain words or sounds have
a similar effect. When the subjects are in this abnormal
condition, they lose their self-control and
mumble or grimace and are apt to do the opposite
of what they are ordered.</p>

<p>In the evening, after another treat to coffee and
tea cakes at Miss Bryant’s, we went to Kutoroge’s
house to draw up the necessary documents. The
old man and Kutoroge received us in a stately manner.
We went into the front room, for the house
has two, the <em>shem</em> being, apparently, an old house,
and squatted down in two facing lines—Mr.
Batchelor, Manuel, and I, facing the clerk, the
policeman, Kutoroge, Shutratek, Sangyea, and
Santukno. We all went through the formal salutations
of hand-rubbing, hand-waving, and beard-stroking.
I then paid one month’s full salary in
advance. The clerk drew up formal receipts,
which were signed, sealed, and witnessed. The
necessary data were taken down for securing legal
applications for passports to leave the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>All formalities having been thus observed, we
were ready to leave. Money was supplied for
securing the necessary equipment for the house at
Saint Louis and for bringing all to the railroad
and we told them when they must appear at Sapporo.
In the morning, our only conveyances were
two small-box, single-horse, two-wheeled carts.
One of these we loaded full with our baggage.
Into the other Manuel and I crowded ourselves,
sitting on the board bottom, with our legs
stretched stiffly crosswise of the cart. When Mr.
Batchelor chose to ride, we all three adopted some
sort of a kneeling or crouching position. Progress
was slow and uncomfortable. Sometimes we
stopped to make photographs, and on one such
stop were able to test this statement in Mr. Batchelor’s
book: “They cut the fat part of the legs
of both males and females at the joint near the
pelvis, and then bind the wound up with the
leather-like layers of the fungus mycelium found
between the bark and the wood of dead oak, elm,
or ash trees.” I had been questioning him about
this practice, raising a query as to its purpose and
its generality. As we were passing through a village,
we met a woman with a baby in her arms,
and Mr. Batchelor inquired of her in regard to it.
After a little hesitation, she showed me the baby,
a little girl perhaps less than a year old. It had
been cut only on the left side, back on the inside
of the leg, just below the buttocks. The cut had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
healed, but the scar was quite plain. The woman
said they do it with babies that kick and squirm too
much. While the practice is probably not general
it is certainly common and widespread, occurring
in several, if not all, villages.</p>

<p>Our progress was so desperately slow that, by
the time we reached Sarabuto, we had almost given
up hope of reaching Azuma for the night. We
were taking tea and cakes at the little tea-house,
when a <em>basha</em> came along making its homeward
journey empty. We gladly hired it, taking some
luggage into it with us and dividing the rest between
the two carts. We then rode away in comparative
comfort and at a much improved speed.
From Mukawa, we walked a little to stretch our
legs, but then rode steadily on to Azuma, arriving
at about four o’clock. The luggage came in later.
We were impressed by the preparations the little
town was making against Russian attack. The
four Russian gunboats are being watched for.
Seven men patrol the coast day and night. At a
signal of two bells from the tower, the women, the
aged, and the helpless are to flee for shelter inland;
at four strokes every able-bodied man and boy is
to seize the nearest thing that can serve as a
weapon and rush to meet the enemy. And no
doubt similar arrangements of desperate bravery
are being made at every miserable fishing village
along this coast!</p>

<p>In the morning we took the <em>basha</em> of yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and a second one for luggage and started early.
It was bitterly cold and from time to time we ran
to warm our feet. At Yubutsu we turned directly
from the sea and struck for the little station of
Numanohata. Here at 9.40 a. m. we took train
for Sapporo, where we had to spend a few days,
packing, completing preparations, and waiting for
our people. Here I had the opportunity of examining
the Japanese books and manuscripts relative
to the Ainu, in the governmental library of the
Hokkaido. The Japanese have been much interested
in the Ainu and have written many works
about them. Most famous and best known is the
<cite>San Goku Tsuran Zusetsu</cite>, by a Rin Shihei. It
was published in 1785 and consists of a volume of
text and five volumes of maps. It is more commonly
found in manuscript than printed. It is
abundantly illustrated with pictures of men and
women, dress, ornaments, tools, and scenes of daily
life. In one picture three Ainu boys are playing the
game of “javelin and ring,” but instead of using
javelins are piercing the rolling ring with arrows
shot from bows. In a family scene, the father
smokes a pipe, but looks around for a moment at
the baby, who seems to point reproachfully at his
mother, who is giving her breast to the bear cub and
not to him; in a cage near by is a captive bird, perhaps
an eagle, waiting sacrifice. In still another
picture, the hunter, from his canoe on the sea, hurls
a harpoon at a seal. The drawings of articles are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
carefully made and serve well for comparison with
modern specimens. On the whole the book gives
interesting information regarding the Ainu of one
hundred and twenty years ago. The most diligent
of the Japanese writers about the Ainu, however,
is Matsuura Takeshiro, a geographer, who
made a loving study of the island of Yezo, publishing
many books between 1850 and 1865. He
takes each section of the island in detail and describes
it from the points of view of topography,
flora, fauna, and ethnology. Almost all of his
many books are illustrated and the pictures are
often strikingly true to life. Takeshiro was a
skillful artist and sometimes painted <em>kakemono</em>, or
hanging scrolls, with Ainu scenes. One of these
is now owned by Professor Miyabe, the accomplished
botanist of the agricultural college at Sapporo.
It is a simple picture, of few lines and delicate
coloring, but it is living. It represents Ainu
in boats on the sea gathering kelp. The picture
is an heirloom, having been given to Professor
Miyabe’s father by the artist, who was his friend.
At the house of Mr. Ishikara, a mining engineer
to whom I had been recommended, I was shown
some manuscript maps made by the old geographer.
They are marvels of patient work and surpass
in their enormous amount of detail in the matter
of local place-names. Among the pictures in
Takeshiro’s books we have excellent material regarding
the Ainu of a half century ago. My own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
interest in these Japanese books relative to Ainu
began in 1891 at the little Museum of Rotterdam
in Holland; it had been nourished by MacRitchie’s
book, <cite>The Ainos</cite>, which depended absolutely upon
such books for its material; it now flamed and
during my brief stay in Japan I brought together
quite a library of such books. I now know of
more than forty <em>printed</em> Japanese works that treat
of the Ainu, most of which are in my collection.
But the printed books are but a small part of
the material representing Japanese observation.
Many more than forty works still exist only in
manuscript, some probably in but a single copy.
There are at Sapporo a goodly number of such
manuscripts, among them one so beautifully and
delicately illustrated that I have had both texts and
pictures carefully copied. At Hakodate and at
Tokio are many more of these unpublished manuscripts,
some of which surely deserve publication.
We cherish the hope of finding some one who will
help us to put some of these quaint and interesting
books into print. To be sure, those without pictures
would mean nothing to the English reader,
but, until they are in print and accessible, they
mean nothing to the students of Japan.</p>

<p>Among these works are many which narrate
the wars between the Ainu and the Japanese. To-day,
recognizing the passive and too yielding nature
of the Ainu, it is difficult to imagine them
as warlike. In hunting, it is true, they are brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
enough, even reckless. But, if they were ever warriors,
they are to-day a broken-spirited and subdued
people. During the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, according to Japanese accounts,
they were great fighters. Even the names of some
great chiefs and descriptions of their deeds of
bravery are consigned to writing.</p>

<p>The Ainu were the old population of Japan and
probably occupied all the islands, even down to
Kiushiu, the southmost. Over the whole area
Ainu names are sprinkled. Even the name of
sacred Fuji-san, the divine mountain, seems to be
Ainu. As the ancestors of the Japanese entered
Japan from the south, they drove back the unhappy
Ainu before them. The encroachment was
gradual, but constant; little by little the Ainu retreated
to the north. Not very long ago there
were still many in the northern part of the main
island; to-day there are none. Yezo, the Kurils,
and Saghalien (now Russian territory) were their
final strongholds. But now Yezo is filling with
vigorous, incoming Japanese, before whom undoubtedly
the Ainu must yield. His little villages,
sprinkled here and there over the island, along the
river-courses or on the sea coast, will disappear.
His life of hunting and fishing is already almost
a thing of the past. To-day the Ainu is “a
ward,” to be guarded by a paternal government,
to be “elevated” by civilization. He is forbidden
to make arrow poison, he is subject to game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
laws, he may no longer have his girls tattooed, he
must send the children to school, he must learn
“the ways of industry,” and till the soil; it is the
old story. We know it as Japan does. We, too,
have wards to be “improved.”</p>

<p>Our Ainu party duly appeared with bag and
baggage. They reported that, at their leaving,
there was a gathering of the village and much
weeping, since they were looked upon as dead men
never again to be seen in the old home. We had
learned immediately on our return to Sapporo that
Bete Goro was <em>anxious</em> to go with us, but had
hesitated about taking him. Goro is young,
shaves, wears Europeanized, not to say Japanized,
clothing. To be sure, he still wears Ainu leggings
with fine embroidery. He is dreadfully
conventional; instead of whittling <em>inao</em>, he knits
stockings! Now, all this is highly commendable,
but it is no qualification for figuring in an Ainu
group at the Exposition. But, Goro was lively
and happy and anxious to go. That was something,
and we believed his influence would do
much to cheer the somewhat morose Yazo, the
timid Shirake, and the group that were mourned
as dead. So we decided he should go. We
should leave his wife, daughter of old Penri’s
widow, behind, in expectation of an event of importance
to the Ainu community. Mr. Batchelor
was asked to communicate the decision, and Goro
was summoned to his study. A moment later Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Batchelor called us to see “what ails this crazy
fellow.” Goro, who had seated himself upon the
floor, was beside himself with joy. He hugged
himself, chuckled, laughed, swayed from side to
side, literally rolled upon the floor. With his accession
our party was complete. Nine Ainu made
up the group—old Sangyea, his wife Santukno,
their little daughter Kin, Kutoroge the bear-hunter,
his wife Shitratek, and their baby girl
Kiko, Yazo, his wife Shirake, and Bete Goro. We
marched the whole company to the police station,
where they were identified, their documents examined
and passports issued permitting them to leave
Japan with us.</p>

<p>We had, however, during this time at Sapporo,
made one side trip. Piratori and the other Saru
towns were so far from the railroad that it had
seemed best not to bring an Ainu house from there.
So we again took the railroad, passed Tomakomai
and Numanohita, and got off the train at Shiraoi,
a railroad town of considerable size. The part
of the town along the track is Japanese. The
Ainu portion, forming perhaps two-thirds of the
whole town, lies between the Japanese quarter and
the sea. Old Parapita had already been sent to
find a house and, promptly on our arrival, the village
chief Shupanram took us to the one selected.
It was small, but typical; the shem, however, was
less than of normal size, so we bought a second
very small house to supply material for a <em>shem</em> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
normal proportions in Saint Louis. The two
houses together cost forty yen (twenty dollars,
U. S. currency) and we ordered twenty yen’s
worth more of thatching. The chief summoned
laborers, men, women and children, the people
who had been living in our house, moved out at
once, and the work of demolition began. We
then took a walk through the town. In some respects
it is unlike the Saru River villages and is,
perhaps, typical of seaside towns within reach of
Japanese influence. The houses are massed quite
closely together; many—most of them—are
protected or sheltered by breaks or guards of bamboo,
built especially at the west doorway; there
was an almost complete absence of storehouses—such
a conspicuous feature in the Saru villages.
But there seems to be the same care in location
with regard to the east and west, the same relative
position of <em>nusa</em>, east window, sacred corner, and
<em>shem</em>. The Ainu here are fine types. Tall, well-built
men are common, one might say, the rule.
The average difference of stature between males of
Shiraoi and the Saru towns is certainly considerable.
Mr. Batchelor tells me that the people of
the northern towns near the western coast, as
Ishikari, are shorter than those at Piratori.
While the stature at Shiraoi is great, the heavy
growth of body hair and the great beards are as
at Piratori. Notwithstanding Japanese neighbors
and the railroad the people at Shiraoi are conservative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
and dress, ornament, utensils, and customs
might be studied here as well as in some more
remote villages. The life is undoubtedly influenced
by the location of the village at the seashore,
but we had no opportunity to study what peculiarities
might be due to that. <em>Nusas</em> are fine and
numerous, and there are bear skulls on many of
them. Here we noticed more conspicuously than
elsewhere a secondary <em>nusa</em>, or rather a little group
of <em>inao</em> stuck into a hillock made of the refuse
from the millet-mortar. More than ever, too,
were we impressed with the coyote-like appearance
of the dogs, which were here numerous.</p>

<p>We had observed two or three men passing,
dressed in ceremonial costume and wearing crowns.
Crowns with bearheads carved from wood occur
here, as elsewhere, but crowns decorated with real
bear claws, one or two, in place of the carved head
of wood, are common. Learning that a drinking
festival was in progress, we went to the place. It
was truly an astonishing and impressive sight.
Everything in the house was decorated with <em>inao</em>
shavings. The sacred east window and the treasure
corner were hung with them. Along the two
sides of the fireplace were squatted eleven or
twelve old men, all wearing their embroidered
ceremonial costumes and their crowns. All held
moustache-lifters in their hands and before some
of them stood cups of millet beer. Four freshly
cut <em>inao</em> were set in line west of the fireplace; next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
came three skulls wrapped in <em>inao</em> shavings, in a
tray; next were two high <em>inao</em> and a large bowl of
millet-beer. When we entered, all the old men
stroked their beards. The leader of the feast sat
in the middle of the line, at the fireplace, with a
bowl of millet beer before him. He went through
the whole elaborate salutation to Mr. Batchelor
and then to me. A second old man did the same.
The master of the feast then offered to make libation
and drink in Mr. Batchelor’s honor, which
offer was refused; a similar offer to me was refused
by proxy. The feast was then resumed. Two or
three young men were assisting, bringing beer, and
otherwise serving. A cup of beer was passed out
through the east window to someone outside, and
we withdrew to see what was done there. Three
blackbeards were worshiping. One took an <em>inao</em>
from a pile of stakes, where it had stood and bore
it to the east window; a servant, inside, passed out
a bowl of beer; the carrier of the <em>inao</em>, taking the
moustache-lifter that lay across the cup, dipped it
and sprinkled the <em>inao</em>. He then carried this to
the <em>nusa</em>, and placed it in position. The other two
had remained standing at the east window; the
bearer, returning, took his place between the others,
one of whom now received a cup of millet beer
and a moustache-stick from the man inside; he
sprinkled both of his companions and spilled a little
of the drink upon the ground; the second then
received a cup and stick and did the same; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
third, the central one, who had placed the <em>inao</em>,
then received the cup and made libation, but did
not sprinkle his companions. All three then
walked to the <em>nusa</em> and sprinkled drops with the
moustache-stick. All of this was done with great
decorum and seriousness and was accompanied by
prayer. We would gladly have seen the remainder
of this festival, but could not stay. The three
negatives we made of it were all failures. The
ceremonial was to secure fine weather; it had long
been bad and a change was greatly desired. The
prayers seem to have been efficacious, for the next
day dawned gloriously.</p>

<p>We were excellently treated by the chief, who
ordered articles brought in for sale, and who at
last, with extraordinary amiability, allowed us to
examine the holiest of holies, the household <em>inao</em>,
which stands in the extreme northeast corner of
the house and ought never to be removed. It is
an upright stick to which loose <em>inao</em> curls are hung,
from time to time, until the mass becomes great.
It represents the spirit of the house and, underneath
the mass of pendant curls, a notch is cut into
which a coal from the hearth, called “the heart,”
is bound. This was brought out for our inspection
and we were even allowed to look at the place of
“the heart.” The coal itself was gone, though
the notch, blackened by the heat, remained, and a
new heart was to be inserted at the next extraordinary
festival of the house. Now passing outside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
we found the house, which we had purchased, a
wreck. A crowd of men, women, and children
were engaged in wrapping, cording, and moving
the materials to the station. It was evening, and,
as we were very tired, we betook ourselves to the
house of the local catechist, a Japanese, where we
ate and slept.</p>

<p>We had brought Mr. Inagaki with us, whose
services as interpreter and caretaker of the Ainu,
we had been so fortunate as to secure. The people
speak no English, of course, but they all know
some Japanese; Mr. Inagaki speaks Japanese and
English. Born in southern Japan, he is studying
for the Episcopal ministry at the theological
school at Tokio, where he is well thought of by
Bishop McKim. His health broke down, and,
forced to discontinue study for a time, he was furloughed
to Yezo, where it was hoped that outdoor
life would do him good. He is willing and competent.
When we left in the morning, he remained
to superintend the shipment of the house
to Muroran, coming up to Sapporo on the afternoon
train. We had been promised a war-club,
but could not secure it last night, as it was in the
house where the feast was in progress. In the
cold, fresh, bright morning, we walked out to
secure it. It was a fine old specimen, well cut,
with the inset piece of iron still in place, black with
the accumulated dirt and smoke of years, and tied
around with fresh <em>inao</em> shavings in honor of yesterday’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
feast. At the last moment the owner
repented and hesitated about selling. But we
secured it and hurried in triumph to our train.
There is no equally good specimen at the Tokio
University, nor in the Sapporo Museum and we
might look long for another so good.</p>

<br>

<p>At last, on Monday, March 7, all was ready,
and our party—nine Ainu, one Japanese, one
Mexican, and one American,—started for the
train. Mr. Batchelor went with us to the station to
bid us Godspeed. Friends were gathered there, in
genuine Japanese style, to see us off. Mr. Bell, a
missionary friend whose acquaintance dated back
to America; Mr. Fujimura, Mr. Ishikara, Professor
Miyabe—all with best wishes. We were
soon upon our way, and reached Muroran shortly
after noon. The Maruichi Hotel was all excitement
over soldiers expected in on a boat at evening.
There had been stormy weather and quantities
of passengers were waiting, and everything
except third-class accommodations on the outgoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
boat was sold. We decided to wait and see what
would be done with the steamer, which was to
bring the soldiers and over which the company
had no control, as it was in the power of the War
Department. If it should be released we could go
on it late to-night; otherwise, we must wait until
to-morrow night. Mr. Batchelor had sent word of
our coming to the local catechist, who had already
received our freight, house and household stuff,
and had shipped them for Aomori; they were
already loaded and would leave upon the regular
night’s boat.</p>

<p>Having done all the business possible, we went
to see an old man who had a little collection of
Stone Age relics, which he had gathered at Cape
Edomo, near by. There were a couple of dozen
arrowheads, small, and of various forms and sizes,
neatly chipped from obsidian, jasper and horn-stone;
there were nine celts or polished blades,
with good edge, made of several kinds of heavy,
compact, hard stone; one of these made of a light
green material showed marks of having been
sawed from a block of stone; there was also a
block of this same stone showing clear signs of
sawing; there were two of the saws that did such
cutting, crude things but showing plain signs of
use, quite large, thin splinters of a hard and tough
material with one side developed into a narrow
cutting edge, striated by sand grains. The old
man did not much care to sell, but we desired something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to represent the Stone Age of Japan, and he
finally did so, at a price, which would soon lead to
bankruptcy, if we continued in the market.</p>

<p>Who were the makers of these early relics?
For some time back we have been attracted by the
theories of Morse, Milne, Hitchcock and others,
that there was a Pre-Ainu race in Japan, which
produced these stone objects and heaped up the
shell-heaps found at many places. It is indeed
hard to reconcile their writings and make a harmonious
whole out of their material. Still we
had finally reached the conclusion that there have
been three populations of Japan. <em>First</em>, the pre-Ainu
aborigines, pit-dwellers, called “earth spiders,”
or “earth hiders.” The evidence for their
existence, Morse’s shell-heaps at Omori with crude
pottery and signs of cannibalism, the pits so common
in Yezo and unquestionably marking ancient
dwelling-sites, Hitchcock’s living “pit-dwellers”
at Shikotan, some references in old Japanese chronicles
and Ainu legends, and the fact (asserted by
Basil Hall Chamberlain) of unanalyzed place-names
in Yezo. <em>Second</em>, the Ainu coming from
the north and penetrating far south, though ever
more numerous in the north. <em>Third</em>, the Japanese
coming from the south and driving the Ainu
northward, coming here and there in contact with
such aborigines as had escaped destruction at the
hands of the Ainu.</p>

<p>The Ainu legends are curious. One of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
is given by Mr. Batchelor as follows: “In very
ancient times a race of people who dwelt in pits
lived among us. They were so very tiny that ten
of them could easily take shelter beneath one burdock
leaf. When they went to catch herrings they
used to make boats by sewing the leaves of bamboo
grass together, and always fished with a hook.
If a single herring was caught it took all the men
of five boats, or even ten sometimes, to hold it
and drag it ashore, while crowds were required
to kill it with their clubs and spears. Yet strange
to say these little men used even to kill great
whales. Surely, these pit-dwellers were gods.”</p>

<p>Now, of course, we never believed in any such
<em>Koropok-guru</em>. But we had been impressed by
the arguments and we had been greatly interested,
at Yokohama, in a chart or diagram, which a
friend had shown us, in which a reconstruction of
the life of this “earliest race of Japan” was attempted.
We were especially astonished at the
detailed information regarding the dress of the
<em>Koropok guru</em>, which the chart seemed to show.
Later, in Tokio, at the University, Prof. Tsuboi
showed us some ancient clay figures of human beings
and it was clear that the author of the chart
had gained his ideas of dress from these. And in
the presence of this instructive chart and the evidence
shown me by this learned Professor my first
doubts regarding their theory arose. Surely the
shell-heaps, the crude pottery, the stone tools, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the old pit-houses were never made by people, who
dressed as those represented in these figures. To-day,
we feel somewhat skeptical with reference to
the whole theory of a pre-Ainu race. Hitchcock’s
pit dwellers of Shikotan are Ainu pure and simple.
In some Ainu towns, particularly in Saghalien, individuals
to-day make pit-houses. Mr. Batchelor
claims now to be able to analyze all Yezo place-names;
we tried him on twenty taken consecutively
from a chance part of Chamberlain’s lists and he
explained all to our satisfaction. There is good
evidence that the Ainu have known the art of
pottery and in their legends references are made
to the practice of cannibalism (points important
against Prof. Morse’s argument). While still
open to argument, we now incline to consider the
Ainu the aboriginal population of Japan. Various
other elements undoubtedly exist among the
population, especially Corean, but on the whole
there have been but two widespread populations—Ainu
and Japanese—and for us these old stone
relics from Cape Edomo are Ainu things.</p>

<p>The war steamer came at evening with six hundred
men and thirty officers. The latter all came
to the Maruichi Hotel and we were all confusion.
To our disappointment we learned that the War
Department would retain the vessel and that no
passengers could be taken. As suddenly as they
had come and with no information as to their
further movements, the soldiers and officers left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
at nine o’clock and we were again in peace. We
were told that another steamer was expected in the
early morning and that we might possibly get off
on it instead of waiting until night. Expecting
that we might be called at six we went at once to
bed. Suddenly, we were roused from our slumber,
and, after hastily dressing, were hustled down
to the shore, from which we were rowed out
through the darkness to the Taconoura Maru.
To our surprise we found that it was now but eleven
o’clock and were soon again in bed. We started
in the early morning and were at Hakodate in
time to hear the noon gun, leaving again at two
o’clock. Goro, our happy Goro, and two of the
women were seasick. Up to Hakodate we had
plenty of room and all was comfortable, but at that
port many passengers embarked and the whole
ship was disagreeably crowded. It was too cold
to stay on deck much, but we could see as we sailed
along the Yezo coast that there was much less
snow than when we made our up-journey. It was
cold and rainy when, at nine o’clock, we anchored
in Aomori harbor and were landed, amid hubbub
and confusion, by the little boat. The next day we
found that the annual snow-cleaning was in progress
and everywhere the great drifts in the streets
were being cut down. We saw, too, what had
been unimagined in our earlier visit, that every
street has an open waterway for carrying off the
melting snow. We stayed at Aomori long enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
to reship our freight and took two nights instead
of one on our way to Tokio, stopping off some
hours, between trains, at Sendai. Railroad operations
had been affected somewhat by the movement
of troops and supplies. Not only were there
fewer trains, but running time was longer, thirty-six
hours instead of twenty between Aomori and
Tokio.</p>

<p>At Tokio, young Mr. Yamada, from Mr. Clement’s
school, met us at the station and told us
that arrangements for board and lodging had been
made for the Ainu at a place near the school. He
also said: “The boys will invite the Ainu people
to our house to-night.” This we really did not
understand until near evening Mr. Clement told
us that the boys were arranging a reception and
that we were all invited. It is the school’s custom
to hold some social function every Saturday
evening. At half past seven, Madam Clement,
Mr. Clement, Mr. Root, Manuel and I went to
the school assembly room, where the boys were
gathered. At the proper time the Ainu appeared,
dressed in their new Japanese garments (the first
purchases with their month’s advance) and were
seated together upon a bench half facing the audience.
We were given chairs of honor in front,
to the left of the leader. The boys of the school,
to the number of about thirty, and Mr. Inagaki
formed the audience. The program and idea of
the reception were entirely original to the boys.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
The reception was opened by prayer and a religious
song; an address of welcome was then given by one
of the older boys and Yazo gave a response; the
boys then sang a religious song in Japanese and
Goro one in Ainu; the boys followed with one or
two addresses and Kutoroge was given his turn—he
became stage-frightened and had to be represented
by Yazo. The orator of the day, a graduate
of the school and now attending the Methodist
college, then made a brilliant address, which
abounded in pathetic and emotional passages, and
was well-received; as this was plainly addressed to
me, he was asked to make an English translation,
in which the oratory lost something, but the meaning
was clear enough—“he recognizes that in
the past the treatment of the Ainu by his own
people has not always been what it should, but that
the sympathy and love of the boys of the school
goes with the Ainu in their long journey; that
they hope I will treat them well and see that others
do the same; that they hope for their safe return;
be good to the Ainu.” To all of which I made a
brief response, thanking the boys for their interest
and sympathy and for their thoughtful and hearty
way of showing them. After singing a final hymn,
they passed around little sacks of cakes to each boy
as his part of the feast. Meantime the Ainu and
I were taken to a table, which we just filled when
we sat down together, with me at the head. We
were then bountifully served by the boys to tea and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
cakes. At the beginning the Ainu were a little
restrained, but when they found that the supply
was ample, they not only ate and drank astonishingly
well, but laid by for future needs, as if they
doubted whether so good a chance would come
again. The other guests, though treated with
less distinguished consideration were not neglected.
When we left the boys saw us off with lighted
lanterns and we felt that their reception had been
a great success.</p>

<p>Mr. Inagaki was deeply touched and must have
painted the reception in glowing colors, because
an invitation came for the Ainu to visit St. Margaret’s
Girls School on Monday afternoon. I
was overwhelmed with work and had to go to
Yokohama in the morning. However taking the
noon train for Tokio, and hastening from the
station to Tsukiji, I was at the school by the appointed
hour. But it was a case of the play of
Hamlet with Hamlet left out. Bishop McKim,
Mr. Tucker, the Japanese principal, Mr. Inagaki,
and one hundred and sixty Japanese girls
were there and waiting; but the Ainu did not come.
We waited, and waited, and to fill the time I told
the girls something about Ainu life. At last we
gave it up and the affair was postponed until the
morrow. Inquiry found that they had not come
because Shirake had a cold! The next day all
except the invalid were present and the affair was
reported to have been a great success. I was unable
to be present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Japan is up to date and the newspaper reporter
knows his business. Though we were far from
the centre of the city and had been quiet in our
movements, the presence of the Ainu in the city
and their location were announced in one of the
papers. The result was that Tuperek appeared.
And who was Tuperek? Old Sangyea’s son.
We had never heard of him before and it was a
long time since his father had heard from him.
He had seen the newspaper notice and called and
had an affecting interview. He is shrewd and
knows something of white men as well as of Japanese.
He is employed upon one of the “yellow journals”
of Tokio. For some time he lived with Mr.
Batchelor and, perhaps under his influence, has
been stimulated to write a book of Ainu stories,
which he plans to publish. He is a well-grown,
strongly-built fellow of perhaps thirty years; he
dresses in Japanese costume and shaves, but the
heavy stubble on his face and the straight eyes
are Ainu. The night before the party left for Yokohama
he called upon us with his father; he
begged to be taken to the Exposition; as they sat
upon the floor before us, they wept as they pleaded.
We ventured various objections, for all of which
he had an answer. There was no time to get his
passport and other documents; he would secure
them and come along upon the next boat. He
could not get into America, without us; oh, yes!
he was connected with the Salvation Army, it could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>easily arrange that matter. As for his appearance,
he knew that it was against him but he still had an
Ainu costume and his beard would soon grow!</p>

<br>

<p>In the morning, we took the party to Yokohama,
leaving them with Mr. Inagaki, to see the
company’s doctor and the wharf doctor, to be inspected,
bathed and fumigated and to secure their
certificates for embarkation; a full day was none
too much. As for us, between tickets and baggage,
arranging for the shipment of the house and
household stuff, and a hundred other things, we
were kept swinging between Tokio and Yokohama.
But at last all was done and on the morning of
March 18, our whole party were aboard the Empress
of Japan, upon which a little separate steerage
had been rigged up for the Ainu where we believed
they would be happier and more secluded
than in the common steerage. On the voyage all
were seasick except the two older men and the two
babies. They probably suffered keenly. At all
events, we are told that the words they use in describing
their sufferings are of the most emphatic.</p>

<p>On the night of the 28th of March, we had
the usual entertainment in the cabin. There were
many Japanese passengers upon the list and, besides
the usual music and recitations, we were favored
with some Japanese sleight-of-hand performances,
and an instrumental solo on a strange
Japanese wind instrument. The proceeds of the
sale of souvenir programs were to be given to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Japanese fund for wounded soldiers. As evidence
of their appreciation of this act, the Japanese at
the close of the program distributed souvenirs to
all the other passengers,— a pretty fan, a bit of
silk, a piece of lacquer. We were invited to contribute
a part to the program by bringing in the
Ainu and making an address about them. The
address was well received but gave occasion to a
little sparring. We did not see the program until
it was printed and then found that we were announced
to present a “short description of the
Aino, followed by an Aino bear-dance by three
of the tribe on board.” Our people were in ceremonial
dress and made a fine appearance. We
described the physical type, the tattooing, the dress
and the salutations, after which Sangyea and Kutoroge
gave a <em>yukara</em> and we made some remarks
about the problem of Ainu origin and relationship.</p>

<p>Had we seen the program, we should not have
permitted the word <em>Aino</em> to appear upon it; nor
should we have allowed announcement of a “bear-dance”
of which we never heard. It is true that
there is dancing at bear-feasts but that is different
from having a dance that is called a bear-dance.
As to the name of our people it is not Aino, but
<em>Ainu</em>, which is a word in their own language meaning
man. The Ainu are “men”—i. e. <em>the</em> men.
It is a common thing for people in a certain stage
of culture to name themselves in this way. The
Eskimo call themselves <em>innuit</em>, “man”; the Moki<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
Indians of Arizona, call themselves <em>hopi</em>, “men”;
and the Delaware Indians called themselves <em>Lenni Lenape</em>,
“men of men.” The word Aino is neither
an Ainu nor a Japanese word; it approaches
the Japanese word <em>ino</em>, “dog,” and there is no
doubt that this similarity shades the word when
used by the Japanese, to whom the Ainu often are
as “dogs” and who have a legend that the Ainu
are really the offspring of a woman and a dog.
From the Ainu point of view the word Aino is a
reproach and they resent it. While it occurs in
many books, there is already ample authority in
practice for using the proper form Ainu, which
should absolutely supplant the other. The matter
is of sufficient importance to have called for
government ruling and in official documents Ainu
is to-day <em>de rigeur</em>. In calling attention to this
matter, we inadvertently offended both English and
Japanese passengers, who had worded the program.</p>

<p>The <em>yukara</em> are curious and interesting but are
rarely, if ever, mentioned in the books. They
are ancient war-songs and we only knew that a
manuscript collection of them exists in the library
at Mito. On inquiring of our men, we learned
that they knew many <em>yukara</em>, so one day upon the
voyage we went down to hear our first one. Kutoroge
was singer; Sangyea beat the time. They
seated themselves side by side upon the floor. Kutoroge
began to sing in a low voice; single words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
were long drawn out and interrupted with curious
throat gurglings; the singing of a single line of
words was a matter of time and great apparent
effort. Sangyea struck one stick against another,
and from time to time gave a cry as if to excite
the other’s courage. Kutoroge grew louder and
the encouragement was more frequent and pronounced,
until both were wrought up to a considerable
pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>It was after sunset, on March 29th, that we
sighted land. The line of hills was but dimly visible
in the low hanging evening haze. Our people
were all below but we called them to the deck.
It took a moment for the first-comers to recognize
what we were showing them, but then their cries,
not at all loud, brought up the others promptly.
Sangyea first and then Kutoroge ceremoniously
seated themselves facing the shore and in silence
rubbed their hands, waved them, and stroked their
beards, in thanksgiving and worship. Having
made this usual salutation, they raised their hands
into the air with the palms toward the land line
and though we could not hear their voices, we believe
they prayed.</p>

<p>At daylight we were plowing through the waters
of the Sound. From Victoria a few hours brought
us to Vancouver, where everything amused and interested
our people. Inspected by one physician
at Victoria, by another at Vancouver, and by a
third in the office of the United States Immigration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Bureau on the Vancouver dock, they must
have wondered what it all meant. We are sure <em>we</em>
did and we do not hesitate to say that of all foolish
pretense at science these inspections deserve the
premium. We refrain from detailing their method,
but will only say that each of the three pursued
a different procedure and that the third one examined
only the eyes. They were all three personally
polite and kind, but the whole thing is a farce.
The immigration officers, among whom we found a
friend, Colonel Albert Whyte, were most polite
and put us to as little trouble and delay as possible.
After our immigration certificates were issued we
waited some little time for the Doctor and as the
people were extremely tired they seated themselves
in the office. Little Kiko was hungry and Shutratek,
like a good mother, was doing her natural
duty by the baby. The Secretary of the Japanese
Consul had come in to see the Ainu; he was all
smiles and friendliness until he saw Shutratek and
the baby. His rebuke was vigorous and probably
the poor woman was warned against future public
care of her baby. The Japanese are all fearful
lest we shall make the error of thinking that the
Ainu are their ancestors or that we shall suppose
the Japanese culture has come out from Ainu!
This sensitiveness we have seen on many occasions.</p>

<br>

<p>We were obliged to spend two nights in Vancouver.
The first night we left the people on the
steamer, taking them on shore, however, for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>walk in the early evening. Many things interested
them, but nothing more than a stuffed elk in a
corner window. Kutoroge looked at it from every
point of view, then heaved a sigh and asked where
such were found alive. We gestured expansively
that they lived in all the country around. He
shook his head expressively and said he’d like to
hunt such deer as that.</p>

<p>In the morning all were removed to one of the
Japanese hotels, after which we went down to pass
the United States Customs Inspection. The great
horses that we met, so unlike the little stocky animals
of Japan, were an unfailing delight to the
men, who wanted to examine them and caress them
but were afraid of them, scared at their least
movement. When we had passed the Customs,
the morning was quite gone and Mr. Mayo, the
Inspector, invited the whole party to the dog show
in the afternoon. It was really a good show and
certainly a thing the Ainu had never dreamed of.
On the whole they were greatly pleased, but Shirake,
frightened at the movement of so many animals
and the noise of so much barking, burst into
tears and cried as if her heart would break.
After the dog show we sent them out to Stanley
Park, that magnificent bit of a primeval forest set
apart for a people’s playground, with Manuel and
Mr. Inagaki. Near evening we went after them
and found them a picture of content. The women
and children were sitting and playing on the grass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
while the men were swinging, with childish delight.
They had been greatly pleased with the living animals
in the cages; we tried to convince Kutoroge
that the grizzly bear was, as the books say, the
same as he knows in Japan, but he insisted that the
Yezo bears were different from any of those here
in captivity.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MANUEL AND KIKO: SALUTATION OF THANKS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>We had been invited to be guests of the local
Japanese mission, conducted by Mr. Kaburagi,
who was educated in the United States. Both he
and his wife speak excellent English. The gathering
took place in the mission rooms in the evening.
Among the half-dozen whites who were
guests were Prof. Odlum and Colonel and Mrs.
Whyte. Prof. Odlum is the President of the local
scientific and historical society and has been in
Yezo. Years before A. Henry Savage Landor
made his journey around the island, of which he
makes such boast in his sadly inaccurate “Alone
with the Hairy Ainu,” Prof. Odlum had gone
over the same ground in much saner fashion. It
was a great pleasure to him to again see Ainu, the
people with whose homes he had once been familiar
and into whose language he had made some
translations. The room in which we were gathered
was suited to a gathering, perhaps of two
hundred persons; if so, there must have been three
hundred present, mostly young Japanese men.
The leader is a natural orator and a man of energy.
A definite program had been arranged between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
him and Mr. Inagaki. Yazo spoke of Ainu agriculture,
Goro of dress and ornament and tattooing,
Kutoroge told of the bear-hunt. Prof. Odlum
was called upon and briefly expressed his sympathy
with Japan in her war and referred to his own
experiences in Yezo. I then spoke in English of
Ainu life and customs, having Kin and Kiko show
salutation, thanks, and petition, which captured the
audience, and the old men gave a <em>yukara</em>. This
trick of Kin and Kiko is one which Manuel discovered
and has a bit developed. On shipboard,
when we carried lumps of sugar or fruits or cakes
down to the children, as we did every afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
we insisted on their standing to receive them. On
seeing the gift, the little hand was raised and the
finger drawn across the upper lip, then the two
hands were crossed one on the other, palms up,
just in front of the body, when the gift was laid
upon them. It was very pretty, particularly when
done by little Kiko. Rarely have we seen such
general interest and close attention as this crowd
of young Japanese gave throughout our little entertainment.
At its close they showered gifts upon
the Ainu. The men each received a dollar;
each woman received cloth for a dress; the children
were given toys and bonbons. To the party collectively
was given a great box of cakes. The
plan had been to give Japanese cakes, as those to
which they were accustomed, but the crafty creatures
had expressed a preference for American
cakes! Loaded down with gifts and completely
tired—a Customs House Inspection, a Dog
Show, a Park Picnic, and an Evening Entertainment
all in one day!—they went home.</p>

<p>Of course, we everywhere attracted crowds. In
Japan these crowds were never troublesome. In
Vancouver fifty persons would gather immediately
on our stopping on the streets, but it was the best
behaved street crowd we have ever seen in a
city of white people. In Seattle it was less tolerant,
but only once was anything absolutely unpleasant
said. In Saint Louis there was more
rudeness, but nowhere was there so much as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
had dreaded. From Seattle to Saint Louis, at
almost every station passed during the daytime,
people crowded to see the Ainu and asked their
questions and made their comments but all good-naturedly.
Several adventures with drunken men
upon the car took place, but these poor fellows
were usually bubbling over with goodwill and were
only troublesome in their well-meant advances of
kindliness. Both at stations and in the cars meetings
with Indians took place and it was curious to
see the mutual close inspection. On the whole the
Ainu took the inspection well and sometimes reciprocated
fully. At Fort Sheridan, Wyoming,
negro soldiers were at the station. Kutoroge was
greatly excited and examined them closely. He
finally asked us whether the color was temporary
or permanent, and then wanted to know whether
it was generally distributed over the body or confined
to the face and hands.</p>

<p>At Seattle, on account of a bad arrangement of
trains we had almost twenty-four hours to wait.
Here the men were much interested in the totem-pole
set up in the city and inquired about its use
and the Indians, who made it. We rode over one
of the great inclined cable-lines; they were a little
timid and quiet on the way up, but when we came
coursing down, their joy was great. Kutoroge
and Goro, in particular, clapped their hands like
children, jumped up and down and shouted with
delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>We were hours late in reaching Saint Louis.
Mr. Hulbert was at the station waiting for our
arrival and at once secured a great coach to take
us in state to the Exposition grounds, where we
arrived at four o’clock in the afternoon of April
6th, the group being temporarily located in the
Government Indian School building. We were
pressed for time; work began at the University on
the 1st of April and we must reach Chicago as
soon as possible. So we told the Ainu that our
time for separation had come and wished them
happiness. Kutoroge hastily ransacked the luggage
and drew out a wooden tray with carved
decoration, which he presented us on behalf of the
party as a token of their affection. All followed
us to the door and stood upon the topmost step;
tears filled their eyes and all were sobbing; they
rubbed their hands and waved them in the air
and the old men stroked their beards. When almost
out of sight we turned and saw them all
standing as before, weeping and waving their partings.</p>

<p>Upon my tray are carved designs, graceful
curves, fillings of criss-cross lines. The Ainu is a
great carver of wooden articles and all he carves
he decorates. Trays, cigarette holders, knife-handles,
tobacco-boxes, pipe-holders, moustache-sticks,
sheaths for knives and swords, spoons—all
of these are decorated with good designs. Only
one student has, so far, made a serious study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Ainu art, Dr. H. Schurtz, of Bremen, Germany.
In a complete study one must investigate not only
the designs cut in wood, but also the patterns
embroidered on dress and the figures tattooed upon
the arms and hands of women. Almost all the
Ainu patterns are highly conventionalized and
many of them are derived from original animal
representations. On the whole Ainu art appears to
be notably independent and characteristic.</p>

<p>Some Italian anthropologists use the terms <em>centripetal</em>
and <em>centrifugal</em> in regard to races. A
centripetal people is one whose customary movements
are toward the person of the actor, not away
from him. Dr. McGee was particularly interested
in securing a group of Ainu, because they have
the reputation of being distinctly centripetal, perhaps
the most so of any people. We had hoped
to find strong evidence of this character, but cannot
claim to have been very successful. It is true
that the salutations are of that kind: the hand-wavings
and beard-strokings are not expansive, outward
movements, but toward the person. The
knife in cutting is frequently, perhaps generally,
drawn toward the cutter. These were the only
centripetal facts which we observed. The method
of singing the <em>yukara</em>, as already described, is very
peculiar; possibly it will come into this category.
Landor, whom we rarely care to quote, says something
in this direction, which may be sound:
“More interesting to me than their physical characters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
were their movements and attitudes, which
I was able to study and note correctly without their
observation. For instance, when Ainu try to move
some heavy body they pull it toward them; thus,
when they drag their dugouts and canoes on shore,
and again when they launch them, they never push
from them but pull toward them. If an Ainu has
to break a stick planted in the ground he does it
by pulling it; whereas a Japanese will push it.
Again in pulling a rope the Ainu pull; the Japanese
push, by placing the rope over one shoulder
and walking in the direction wanted. In a crowd,
where a Japanese would push his way through by
extending his arms and thus separating people, the
Ainu seizes a man on each side, pulling one to the
right and the other to the left, till space for him
to pass is made.” Now, if these are correct observations
and we are inclined to accept them as
such, they illustrate the centripetal nature of the
Ainu and the centrifugal nature of the Japanese.</p>

<p>The physical characters of the Ainu and the Japanese
differ profoundly. The Ainu present a peculiar
and strongly marked type. On the whole
they are short; Batchelor gives 5 ft. 4 in. as the
average stature for men and 5 ft. 1½ in. or 5 ft.
2 in. as the average for women. It is true, however,
that stature varies considerably with locality—the
men of Shiraoi being relatively tall and well
built, those of Piratori medium, and those of Ishikari
smaller and badly developed. The Ainu skin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
though dark, is white, not yellow or brown; the
color appears darker than it really is because the
Ainu rarely bathe. The hair is abundant both on
the body and the head, and is wavy; the color is
commonly black, though it may be dark-brown or
even reddish; like wavy hair everywhere, it presents
an elliptical, not a circular, cross-section.
The beard in males is strong and abundant. The
features are those of the white race rather than
the yellow; the nose is prominent and well formed,
the mouth is strong; the lips firm. The eyes are
brown, sometimes even light brown. Mark these
characters well; compare them with those of the
Japanese. How profound the difference. The
white skin, abundant body hair and beard, the hair
wavy and of elliptical section, the horizontal eye
full of expression and fire, the features combined
into a strong relief—these are in strong contrast
to the yellow-brown skin, hairless face and body,
straight and round hair, oblique eyes and flat face
of the Japanese. In all these respects in which the
Ainu differs so profoundly from the Japanese, he
resembles us, the whites of European race.</p>

<p>They are often called “the hairy Ainu” and
we consider the term just. It is true that their
proximity to the smooth-bodied yellow Asiatics has
made their hairiness conspicuous by contrast. It
is true that many writers, who have spoken of
“fur” and “missing links,” have overstated
facts; but it is also true that notably hairy bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
are the rule among the males. Individual Russians
are no doubt common, who are as hairy as the
average Ainu, but we believe firmly that taken
<em>en masse</em> the Ainu are more hairy than the Russians,
and probably the hairiest people on the globe.
Of course, the Ghiliaks, living on the Asiatic mainland
and undoubtedly related with them, present
the same peculiarity. Hitchcock gives a lot of excellent
data in regard to Ainu hairiness.</p>

<p>As different are the Japanese and Ainu in language.
Years ago, Basil Hall Chamberlain drew
up a detailed comparison between the two, pointing
out fifteen points of difference, and he might
have extended the list indefinitely. Nor are the
differences he indicates of trifling significance. On
the contrary they are vital and concern the most
important constructional matters. Thus, in the
Ainu, verbs have true passive forms like those of
European languages, the Japanese in its most earnest
effort to express a passive cannot get rid of
an active viewpoint; the Ainu has many reflective
verbs, the Japanese has none; “Ainu pronouns
are used at every turn like the pronouns of modern
European languages,” Japanese has no real and
simple pronouns; in Ainu “honorifics” are lacking,
in Japanese they abound. Mr. Batchelor’s
little <cite>Grammar of the Ainu Language</cite> is interesting
reading, even if it does not convince the reader
that Ainu is an “Aryan language.” Years ago
the Japanese government of the Hokkaido published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Mr. Batchelor’s <cite>A Dictionary of the Ainu</cite>,
now long out of print. During the time that has
since elapsed he had added enormously to the work
and his present manuscript represents the labor of a
quarter of a century. It is now complete and ought
to be printed without delay. As long as it remains
in manuscript it is in danger; once lost, it could
never be replaced, even by the author, for the use
of Ainu as a speech is passing.</p>

<p>Who are the Ainu? Where did they come
from? What is their past? They are surely a
white people, not a yellow. They are more our
brothers, though they live so far away, than brothers
of the Japanese, to whom, in place, they are
so near. That is not to say that all men are not
brothers; our meaning we think clear. We, white
men, are fond of assuming an air of great superiority,
when we speak of other peoples. We take
it for granted that all white men are better than
any red ones, or black ones, or yellow ones. Yet
here we find a <em>white race that has struggled and
lost</em>! It has proved inferior in life’s battle to
the more active, energetic, progressive, yellow people,
with which it has come in contact. It may
be that the Ainu are but a little fragment of a once
widespread Asiatic white race. The Ghiliaks, the
Mao-tse (“hairy”) of China, some small populations
of southeastern Asia and the curious non-aggressive
Todas of India with their great beards
and strange customs, may be other fragments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
that same old population. We cannot assert it;
study and comparison will be necessary before the
assertion would be warranted; but we believe such
comparison may prove what we suggest. Should
it do so, that old white race was broken and submerged
by a great flood of active yellow Asiatics,
who pressed eastward from their old home, perhaps
in Mesopotamia.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">HOUSE IN DEMOLITION: SHIRAOI.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Our poor Ainu longed for their house, which
was slow in coming. When it, at last, arrived they
were astonishingly prompt in rearing it. The traditional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
method of construction was followed and a
feast celebrated its completion. Unfortunately,
we could not be present, but a week later a post-rehearsal
was given for our benefit. The Saint
Louis house consists of the main eastern part, and
the western <em>shem</em>; these are separated to give better
circulation of air and the passage between
them is roofed over; a curtain of matting hangs in
the west doorway; the ground is covered with
mattings and the walls are hung with them; there
are the usual east and south windows, fireplace, and
treasure corner. At the feast Sangyea officiated
as the head of the house, Santukno, as his wife,
assisting. They were seated to the north of the
fireplace; the rest of the household were to the
south; the guests of consequence were seated upon
fine mattings to the east of the fireplace; others sat
along the north and west sides. When all were
seated the <em>inao</em> to the fire-goddess were placed;
then the other <em>inao</em> of the house were put in their
proper places. Kutoroge next made the new fire
for the hearth, not with matches but with the ancient
flint and steel, the spark being caught in tinder
in a sort of horn or cup; as soon as the spark
was caught, a piece of dried elm-root was fitted
into the opening of this receptacle, and vigorously
sucked at the upper end until the whole lower end,
in contact with the lighted tinder, was in a glow,
when the fire was started with it. The treasures
were then located in their corner and the <em>inao</em> guardian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of the house set up. All now went outside
while Yazo placed the roof <em>inao</em>. Next the <em>nusa</em>
was constructed to the east of the house, before
the sacred window, while Sangyea prayed. Returning
to the house cups and moustache-sticks
were produced. Goro filled the cups and Sangyea
made an offering to the east and to the <em>inao</em> of the
fireplace, drank half the cup, giving the rest to
Santukno; drink was now served to all the members
of the household and to the guests. Then
for the first time in the new home the women
pounded millet in the mortar, singing songs without
words to time the pounding. The younger
men then threw beans to the little children, to the
household and to the guests, after which millet-cakes
were served. When all was ended the house-master
expressed his appreciation of the interest of
the guests as shown by their presence.</p>

<p>The house truly presented a gay showing of
<em>inao</em>. Those for the fireplace are called <em>chi e horo
ka kep</em>. There were four of them in line at the
east end of the fireplace; the top end is four-cleft
and there are two tufts of shavings at different
heights; in the upper tuft were three small bunches,
neatly curled; in the lower tuft, were two bunches;
in shaving these the movement is downward and
toward the cutter; the bark is left on the lower
part of the sticks; these <em>inao</em> should be burned after
the ceremony. The <em>chise koro inao</em> were two
in number, one to the north, the other to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
south, of the fireplace; they are cut squarely across
at the upper end and tapered gradually below;
no bark is left upon them; they are for the household
god and, after the ceremony should be placed
with it in the northeast corner. <em>Inao kike</em>, loose
shaving curls, were hung at the entrance and at
the sides of the two windows; when evil people
look in at the window, where these are located,
the god strikes them in the face; only evil people
<em>will</em> look in at a window. Great <em>inao</em>, with beautifully
curled masses of shavings, called <em>kike parase</em>
were fastened—one at the south window, one
somewhat larger at the east window, another still
larger on the roof beam above the south end of
the fireplace; those at the windows are to keep
away evil spirits and ghosts; that bound to the
beam is dedicated to the god who holds up the
house; the two on the roof, at the ends of the ridgepole
were of the same kind and were to ward
off harm from winds and evil birds. <em>Chise koro
inao</em> is a name used only while that kind of an
<em>inao</em> is at the fireplace; when it is elsewhere it is
called <em>kike chinoe</em>; the shaving curls of which it is
composed may be twisted together into cords giving
it an entirely peculiar and different appearance.
Most important of all, however, is the <em>inao netobe</em>;
this is the one at the extreme northeast corner of
the room, and, even for our inspection the people
were unwilling to bring it out, though they showed
it to me in its place, in full detail; the top end is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>cut obliquely at a single stroke, and the resulting
slope is called “the face”; the bark is left on and
in it three notches are cut, at each of three levels,
around the stick, nine in all; cords of <em>kike inao</em>
are tied around this stick and rest upon these
notches, as supports; these cords bind in place pendant
<em>kike</em>; as new household festivals occur new
<em>kike</em> are added until a great bunch of them is
formed; under this mass of pendant shavings the
coal from the hearth is bound; a little arrow or
spear is laid among the shavings and a miniature
sword is bound to the upright; this <em>inao</em> represents
the very spirit of the house, and while it ought
never to be moved during the lifetime of the house,
it should be destroyed if the house is deserted.
The <em>nusa</em> to the east of the house consisted of
twenty sticks of which twelve were long, eight
short. The longer ones consist of support sticks
to which <em>kike parase</em> were lashed, both support and
<em>inao</em> being cut to neat sloping surfaces for fitting.
The shorter sticks were cut with a single sloping
stroke, giving a “face,” which was slit across with
one cut, “the mouth”; in each mouth <em>inao</em> shavings
were thrust. The shorter sticks are said to be
merely ornamental; the longer ones are sacred.
The one to the left is the moon, the next the wells,
next bears, the rest are mountains in which bears
are hunted.</p>

<p>In Yezo, when an Ainu has been away from the
village and returns, his home-coming is made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>public occasion. All the people gather, someone
being their spokesman. He and the traveller seat
themselves facing. He who has been away begins
to sing, narrating his adventures, telling where
he has been and what he has seen and done. Presently
he stops and the other begins to sing the happenings
of the village during the traveller’s absence
from home. So they sing, alternating, until
both stories are completed. When our Ainu group
returns, they will be received as those who were
dead and have returned; what a many things the
poor fellows will have to sing of the people and
the places they have seen so far away from their
home villages in the Saru River valley.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
